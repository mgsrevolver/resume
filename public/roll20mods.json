        "script": "ChatSetAttr.js",
        "version": "1.10",
        "description": "# ChatSetAttr\n\nThis script is a utility that allows the user to create, modify, or delete character attributes via chat messages or macros. There are several options that determine which attributes are modified, and which characters the attributes are modified for. The script is called by the command **!setattr [--options]** for creating or modifying attributes, or **!delattr [--options]** for deleting attributes.\n\n## Selecting a target\n\nOne of the following options must be specified; they determine which characters are affected by the script.\n\n* **--all** will affect all characters in the game. USE WITH CAUTION. This option will only work for the GM. If you have a large number of characters in your campaign, this will take a while to process all attribute changes.\n* **--allgm** will affect all characters which do not have a controlling player set, which typically will be every character that is not a player character. USE WITH CAUTION. This option will only work for the GM.\n* **--charid charid1, charid2, ...** allows you to supply a list of character ids, and will affect characters whose ids come from this list. Non-GM Players can only affect characters that they control.\n* **--name name1, name2, ...** allows you to supply a list of character names, and will look for a character with this name to affect. Non-GM Players can only affect characters that they control.\n* **--sel** will affect all characters that are represented by tokens you have currently selected.\n\n## Inline commands\n\nIt is possible to use some ChatSetAttr commands in the middle of a roll template, with some limitations. To do so, write the ChatSetAttr command between the properties of a roll template, and end it \"!!!\". If one of the attribute values is a whole roll template property, the first inline roll within that property will be used instead. It is easiest to illustrate how this works in an example:\n\n```\n&{template:default} {{name=Cthulhu}} !modattr --silent --charid @{target|character\\_id} --sanity|-{{Sanity damage=[[2d10+2]]}} --corruption|{{Corruption=Corruption increases by [[1]]}}!!! {{description=Text}}\n```\n\nThis will decrease sanity by 2d10+2 and increase corruption by 1 for the character selected with the --charid @{target|character\\_id} command. **It is crucial** that the ChatSetAttr part of the command is ended by three exclamation marks like in the message above – this is how the script know when to stop interpreting the roll template as part of the ChatSetAttr command.\n\n## Additional options\n\nThese options will have no effect on **!delattr**, except for **--silent**.\n\n* **--silent** will suppress normal output; error messages will still be displayed.\n* **--mute** will suppress normal output as well as error messages (hence **--mute** implies **--silent**).\n* **--replace** will replace the characters < , > , ~ , ; , and ` by the characters [,],-,?, and @ in attribute values. This is useful when you do not want roll20 to evaluate your expression in chat before it is parsed by the script. Alternatively, you can use \\lbrak, \\rbrak, \\n, \\at, and \\ques to create [, ], a newline, @, and ?.\n* **--nocreate** will change the script's default behaviour of creating a new attribute when it cannot find one; instead, the script will display an error message when it cannot find an existing attribute with the given name.\n* **--mod** will add the new value to the existing value instead of replacing it. If the existing value is a number (or empty, which will be treated as 0), the new value will be added to the existing value. If not, an error message will be displayed instead. Try not to apply this option to attributes whose values are not numbers. You can use **!modattr** as a shortcut for **!setattr --mod**.\n* **--modb** works like **--mod**, except that the attribute's current value is kept between 0 and its maximum. You can use **!modbattr** as a shortcut for **!setattr --modb**.\n* **--reset** will simply reset all entered attribute values to the maximum; the values you enter are ignored. You can use **!resetattr** as a shortcut for **!setattr --reset**.\n* **--evaluate** is a GM-only (unless you allow it to be used by players via the configuration) option that will use JavaScript eval() to evaluate the attribute value expressions. This allows you to do math in expressions involving other attributes (see the example below). However, this option is inherently dangerous and prone to errors, so be careful.\n\n## Feedback options\n\nThe script accepts several options that modify the feedback messages sent by the script.\n\n* **--fb-public** will send the output to chat publicly, instead of whispering it to the player who sent the command. Note that error messages will still be whispered.\n* **--fb-from <NAME>** will modify the name that appears as the sender in chat messages sent by the script. If not specified, this defaults to \"ChatSetAttr\".\n* **--fb-header <STRING>** will replace the title of the message sent by the script - normally, \"Setting Attributes\" or \"Deleting Attributes\" - with a custom string.\n* **--fb-content <STRING>** will replace the feedback line for every character with a custom string. This will not work with **!delattr**.\n\nYou can use the following special character sequences in the values of both **--fb-header** and **--fb-content**. Here, **J** is an integer, starting from 0, and refers to the **J**-th attribute you are changing. They will be dynamically replaced as follows:\n\n* \\_NAME**J**\\_: will insert the attribute name.\n* \\_TCUR**J**\\_: will insert what you are changing the current value to (or changing by, if you're using **--mod** or **--modb**).\n* \\_TMAX**J**\\_: will insert what you are changing the maximum value to (or changing by, if you're using **--mod** or **--modb**).\n\nIn addition, there are extra insertion sequence that only make sense in the value of **--fb-content**:\n\n* \\_CHARNAME\\_: will insert the character name.\n* \\_CUR**J**\\_: will insert the final current value of the attribute, for this character.\n* \\_MAX**J**\\_: will insert the final maximum value of the attribute, for this character.\n\n## Attribute Syntax\n\nAttribute options will determine which attributes are set to which value (respectively deleted, in case of !delattr). The syntax for these options is **--name|value** or **--name|value|max**. Here, **name** is the name of the attribute (which is parsed case-insensitively), **value** is the value that the current value of the attribute should be set to, and **max** is the value that the maximum value of the attribute should be set to. Instead of the vertical line ('|'), you may also use '#' (for use inside roll queries, for example).\n\n* Single quotes (') surrounding **value** or **max** will be stripped, as will trailing spaces. If you need to include spaces at the end of a value, enclose the whole expression in single quotes.\n* If you want to use the '|' or '#' characters inside an attribute value, you may escape them with a backslash: use '|' or '#' instead.\n* If the option is of the form **--name|value**, then the maximum value will not be changed.\n* If it is of the form **--name||max**, then the current value will not be changed.\n* You can also just supply **--name|** or **--name** if you just want to create an empty attribute or set it to empty if it already exists, for whatever reason.\n* **value** and **max** are ignored for **!delattr**.\n* If you want to empty the current attribute and set some maximum, use **--name|''|max**.\n* The script can deal with repeating attributes, both by id (e.g. **repeating\\_prefix\\_-ABC123\\_attribute**) and by row index (e.g. **repeating\\_prefix\\_$0\\_attribute**). If you want to create a new repeating row in a repeating section with name **prefix**, use the attribute name **repeating\\_prefix\\_-CREATE\\_name**. If you want to delete a repeating row with **!delattr**, use the attribute name **repeating\\_prefix\\_ID** or **repeating\\_prefix\\_$rowNumber**.\n* You can insert the values of \\_other\\_ attributes into the attributes values to be set via %attribute\\_name%. For example, **--attr1|%attr2%|%attr2_max%** will insert the current and maximum value of **attr2** into those of **attr1**.\n\n## Examples\n\n* **!setattr --sel --Strength|15** will set the Strength attribute for 15 for all selected characters.\n* **!setattr --name John --HP|17|27 --Dex|10** will set HP to 17 out of 27 and Dex to 10 for the character John (only one of them, if more than one character by this name exists).\n* **!delattr --all --gold** will delete the attribute called gold from all characters, if it exists.\n* **!setattr --sel --mod --Strength|5** will increase the Strength attribute of all selected characters by 5, provided that Strength is either empty or has a numerical value - it will fail to have an effect if, for example, Strength has the value 'Very big'.\n* **!setattr --sel  --Ammo|%Ammo_max%** will reset the Ammo attribute for the selected characters back to its maximum value.\n* If the current value of attr1 is 3 and the current value of attr2 is 2, **!setattr --sel --evaluate --attr3|2*%attr1% + 7 - %attr2%** will set the current value of attr3 to 15.\n\n## Global configuration\n\nThere are three global configuration options, _playersCanModify_, _playersCanEvaluate_, and _useWorkers_, which can be toggled either on this page or by entering **!setattr-config** in chat. The former two will give players the possibility of modifying characters they don't control or using the **--evaluate** option. You should only activate either of these if you can trust your players not to vandalize your characters or your campaign. The last option will determine if the script triggers sheet workers on use, and should normally be toggled on.\n## Registering observers\n\n**Note:** this section is only intended to be read by script authors. If you are not writing API scripts, you can safely ignore this.\n\nChanges made by API scripts do not trigger the default Roll20 event handlers, by default. While perhaps a sensible choice in order to prevent infinite loops, it is unfortunate if you do want your script to ChatSetAttr-induced attribute changes. To this end, ChatSetAttr offers an observer pattern. You can register your script with ChatSetAttr like you would register Roll20 event handlers, and your handler functions will be called by ChatSetAttr. The syntax is\n\n`ChatSetAttr.registerObserver(event, observer);`\n\nwhere `event` is one of `\"add\"`, `\"change\"`, or `\"destroy\"`, and `observer` is the event handler function (with identical structure like the one you would pass to e.g. a `\"change:attribute\"` event).",

Alternatively, you can use \\lbrak, \\rbrak, \\n, \\at, and \\ques to create [, ], a newline, @, and ?.</li>\n<li><strong>--nocreate</strong> will change the script&#39;s default behaviour of creating a new attribute when it cannot find one; instead, the script will display an error message when it cannot find an existing attribute with the given name.</li>\n<li><strong>--mod</strong> will add the new value to the existing value instead of replacing it. If the existing value is a number (or empty, which will be treated as 0), the new value will be added to the existing value. If not, an error message will be displayed instead. Try not to apply this option to attributes whose values are not numbers. You can use <strong>!modattr</strong> as a shortcut for <strong>!setattr --mod</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>--modb</strong> works like <strong>--mod</strong>, except that the attribute&#39;s current value is kept between 0 and its maximum. You can use <strong>!modbattr</strong> as a shortcut for <strong>!setattr --modb</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>--reset</strong> will simply reset all entered attribute values to the maximum; the values you enter are ignored. You can use <strong>!resetattr</strong> as a shortcut for <strong>!setattr --reset</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>--evaluate</strong> is a GM-only (unless you allow it to be used by players via the configuration) option that will use JavaScript eval() to evaluate the attribute value expressions. This allows you to do math in expressions involving other attributes (see the example below). However, this option is inherently dangerous and prone to errors, so be careful.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Feedback options</h2>\n\n<p>The script accepts several options that modify the feedback messages sent by the script.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>--fb-public</strong> will send the output to chat publicly, instead of whispering it to the player who sent the command. Note that error messages will still be whispered.</li>\n<li><strong>--fb-from </strong> will modify the name that appears as the sender in chat messages sent by the script. If not specified, this defaults to &quot;ChatSetAttr&quot;.</li>\n<li><strong>--fb-header </strong> will replace the title of the message sent by the script - normally, &quot;Setting Attributes&quot; or &quot;Deleting Attributes&quot; - with a custom string.</li>\n<li><strong>--fb-content </strong> will replace the feedback line for every character with a custom string. This will not work with <strong>!delattr</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You can use the following special character sequences in the values of both <strong>--fb-header</strong> and <strong>--fb-content</strong>. Here, <strong>J</strong> is an integer, starting from 0, and refers to the <strong>J</strong>-th attribute you are changing. They will be dynamically replaced as follows:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>_NAME<strong>J</strong>_: will insert the attribute name.</li>\n<li>_TCUR<strong>J</strong>_: will insert what you are changing the current value to (or changing by, if you&#39;re using <strong>--mod</strong> or <strong>--modb</strong>).</li>\n<li>_TMAX<strong>J</strong>_: will insert what you are changing the maximum value to (or changing by, if you&#39;re using <strong>--mod</strong> or <strong>--modb</strong>).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>In addition, there are extra insertion sequence that only make sense in the value of <strong>--fb-content</strong>:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>_CHARNAME_: will insert the character name.</li>\n<li>_CUR<strong>J</strong>_: will insert the final current value of the attribute, for this character.</li>\n<li>_MAX<strong>J</strong>_: will insert the final maximum value of the attribute, for this character.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Attribute Syntax</h2>\n\n<p>Attribute options will determine which attributes are set to which value (respectively deleted, in case of !delattr). The syntax for these options is <strong>--name|value</strong> or <strong>--name|value|max</strong>. Here, <strong>name</strong> is the name of the attribute (which is parsed case-insensitively), <strong>value</strong> is the value that the current value of the attribute should be set to, and <strong>max</strong> is the value that the maximum value of the attribute should be set to. Instead of the vertical line (&#39;|&#39;), you may also use &#39;#&#39; (for use inside roll queries, for example).</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Single quotes (&#39;) surrounding <strong>value</strong> or <strong>max</strong> will be stripped, as will trailing spaces. If you need to include spaces at the end of a value, enclose the whole expression in single quotes.</li>\n<li>If you want to use the &#39;|&#39; or &#39;#&#39; characters inside an attribute value, you may escape them with a backslash: use &#39;|&#39; or &#39;#&#39; instead.</li>\n<li>If the option is of the form <strong>--name|value</strong>, then the maximum value will not be changed.</li>\n<li>If it is of the form <strong>--name||max</strong>, then the current value will not be changed.</li>\n<li>You can also just supply <strong>--name|</strong> or <strong>--name</strong> if you just want to create an empty attribute or set it to empty if it already exists, for whatever reason.</li>\n<li><strong>value</strong> and <strong>max</strong> are ignored for <strong>!delattr</strong>.</li>\n<li>If you want to empty the current attribute and set some maximum, use <strong>--name|&#39;&#39;|max</strong>.</li>\n<li>The script can deal with repeating attributes, both by id (e.g. <strong>repeating_prefix_-ABC123_attribute</strong>) and by row index (e.g. <strong>repeating_prefix_$0_attribute</strong>). If you want to create a new repeating row in a repeating section with name <strong>prefix</strong>, use the attribute name <strong>repeating_prefix_-CREATE_name</strong>. If you want to delete a repeating row with <strong>!delattr</strong>, use the attribute name <strong>repeating_prefix_ID</strong> or <strong>repeating_prefix_$rowNumber</strong>.</li>\n<li>You can insert the values of _other_ attributes into the attributes values to be set via %attribute_name%. For example, <strong>--attr1|%attr2%|%attr2_max%</strong> will insert the current and maximum value of <strong>attr2</strong> into those of <strong>attr1</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Examples</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>!setattr --sel --Strength|15</strong> will set the Strength attribute for 15 for all selected characters.</li>\n<li><strong>!setattr --name John --HP|17|27 --Dex|10</strong> will set HP to 17 out of 27 and Dex to 10 for the character John (only one of them, if more than one character by this name exists).</li>\n<li><strong>!delattr --all --gold</strong> will delete the attribute called gold from all characters, if it exists.</li>\n<li><strong>!setattr --sel --mod --Strength|5</strong> will increase the Strength attribute of all selected characters by 5, provided that Strength is either empty or has a numerical value - it will fail to have an effect if, for example, Strength has the value &#39;Very big&#39;.</li>\n<li><strong>!setattr --sel  --Ammo|%Ammo_max%</strong> will reset the Ammo attribute for the selected characters back to its maximum value.</li>\n<li>If the current value of attr1 is 3 and the current value of attr2 is 2, <strong>!setattr --sel --evaluate --attr3|2*%attr1% + 7 - %attr2%</strong> will set the current value of attr3 to 15.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Global configuration</h2>\n\n<p>There are three global configuration options, <em>playersCanModify</em>, <em>playersCanEvaluate</em>, and <em>useWorkers</em>, which can be toggled either on this page or by entering <strong>!setattr-config</strong> in chat. The former two will give players the possibility of modifying characters they don&#39;t control or using the <strong>--evaluate</strong> option. You should only activate either of these if you can trust your players not to vandalize your characters or your campaign. The last option will determine if the script triggers sheet workers on use, and should normally be toggled on.</p>\n\n<h2>Registering observers</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> this section is only intended to be read by script authors. If you are not writing API scripts, you can safely ignore this.</p>\n\n<p>Changes made by API scripts do not trigger the default Roll20 event handlers, by default. While perhaps a sensible choice in order to prevent infinite loops, it is unfortunate if you do want your script to ChatSetAttr-induced attribute changes. To this end, ChatSetAttr offers an observer pattern. You can register your script with ChatSetAttr like you would register Roll20 event handlers, and your handler functions will be called by ChatSetAttr. The syntax is</p>\n\n<p><code>ChatSetAttr.registerObserver(event, observer);</code></p>\n\n<p>where <code>event</code> is one of <code>&quot;add&quot;</code>, <code>&quot;change&quot;</code>, or <code>&quot;destroy&quot;</code>, and <code>observer</code> is the event handler function (with identical structure like the one you would pass to e.g. a <code>&quot;change:attribute&quot;</code> event).</p>\n"

      "shortname": "groupcheck",
      "jsoninfo": {
        "name": "GroupCheck",
        "script": "GroupCheck.js",
        "version": "1.12",
        "description": "\n\n# GroupCheck\nThis is an API script meant to run checks for several tokens at once. You can specify the type of check to run and it will roll it once for every selected token. Note that you **will** have to configure the script and import the right types of checks before you can use it.\n\n## Basic usage\nHaving configured some checks, you can call the script using the following syntax\n\n\t!group-check [--options] --Check Command\n\nHere, you can supply zero or more options (see the section on options for specifics) that modify what exactly is rolled. **Check Command** is the command associated to the check you want to run. If no valid **Check Command** is supplied, a list of valid commands (in the form of API buttons) is instead output to chat, allowing you to press them to roll the corresponding check.\n**Check Command** will then be rolled once for every selected token that represents a character, and the result will be output to chat.\n\n### Example\nSuppose that we are using D&D 5E, and want to roll a Dexterity saving throw for every selected token, outputting the result to the GM only. The command would be\n\n\t!group-check --whisper --Dexterity Save\nNote that this only works after having imported the right data for the sheet you are using.\n\nIf you have two tokens selected, representing the characters **Sarah** and **Mark**, the script will output (with default settings)\n\n**Sarah:** [[d20 + @{Sarah|dexterity\\_saving\\_throw\\_mod}]]\n\n**Mark:** [[d20 + @{Mark|dexterity\\_saving\\_throw\\_mod}]]\n\nInternally, the form of the check is proscribed by a formula; the formula in this case is of the form \"[[d20 + @{dexterity\\_saving\\_throw\\_mod}]]\", and the script will fill in the right attribute in place of \"@{dexterity\\_saving\\_throw\\_mod}\".\n\n## Configuration\nThe script is designed to be easily configured to your specific system's needs. You can configure the script using the **!group-check-config** command. **!group-check-config** accepts the following options:\n\n### Show options\n\n* **!group-check-config --show** will display the current list of checks and the default options for GroupCheck.\n\n### Manipulating the check database\n* **!group-check-config --import [Name]** imports a predefined set of checks and adds them to the list. Currently, the available choices for **[Name]** are **5E-Shaped**, **5E-OGL**, **Pathfinder-Official**,**Pathfinder-Community**, and **3.5**.\n\n* **!group-check-config --add [JSON]**  adds a check, or several checks, to the list of checks in the database. **[JSON]** must be valid JSON in the following format:\n\n\t{ \"Check Command\" : { \"name\" : \"Check Name\", \"formula\" : \"FORMULA\"} }\nHere, the command will be called by **!group-check --Check Command**, the title of the box appearing in chat will be Check Name, and FORMULA is the formula used to calculate the roll result. Attributes to be filled in in FORMULA need to be specified as \\at{name}; inline roll brackets (\"[[\" or \"]]\") should be replaced by \"\\\\[\", respectively \"\\\\]\". For example, to add a check with command Strength that roll a d20 + the character's Strength attribute, you would type\n\n\t!group-check-config --add { \"Strength\" : { \"name\" : \"Strength Test\", \"formula\" : \"\\[d20 + \\at{Strength}\\]\"} }\n\n* **!group-check-config --delete [Command]** will delete the check called **Command** from the database.\n\n* **!group-check-config --clear** will empty the list of checks in the database.\n\n### Manipulating default options\n\n* **!group-check-config --set option value** will set **option** to **value**. The following options are available: **ro**, **die_adv**, **die_dis**, **fallback**, and **globalmod**. To find out more about what these options do, consult the Options sections.\n\n* **!group-check-config --set option** will set **option** (this is the variant for options which can be either true or false). The following options are available: **showformula**, **hideformula**, **whisper**, **public**, **usecharname**, **usetokenname**, **showpicture**, and **hidepicture**, **direct** and **process**. To find out more about what these options do, consult the Options section.\n\n* **!group-check-config --defaults** will reset all options to the factory defaults.\n\n* **!group-check-config --reset** will both empty the list of checks and reset all options.\n\n## Options\nMost of the following options can be supplied in two ways: you can either supply them on the command line, or change the defaults via !group-check-config. Most of the time, it is probably advisable to do the latter.\n\n### Targeting\nBy default, the script will be run for every selected token. Alternatively, if the **--ids IDs** option is specified, it will instead run for every token in **IDs**, which is supplied in the form of a comma-separated list of token IDs. This shouldn't normally be necessary, but it could be useful for generating GroupCheck commands via an API script.\n\n### List of options\n\n* The options **die_adv**, and **die_dis** control the die substitution for disadvantage and advantage. The first d20 in the roll formula will be replaced by the value of die\\_adv resp. die\\_dis if the roll option adv for Advantage or dis for Disadvantage is specified.\n\n* The options **whisper**, resp. **public**, control if rolls are whispered to the GM or output publicly.\n\n* You can use the option **--title [text]** to display **[text]** instead of the normal title of the roll.\n\n* You can use the option **--subheader [text]** to display **[text]** below the title of your roll.\n\n* The options **--direct** and **--process** let GroupCheck use the rolls in two very different ways (you probably want to set this option via !group-check-config permanently instead of specifying it for every roll). **--direct** is the default, and equals the behaviour of GroupCheck prior to version 1.0, in that it simply outputs inline rolls to chat. On the other hand, **--process** lets GroupCheck process the results first to change their appearance and pass on the results to other scripts. Since **--process** has not been tested for many cases yet, this could lead to strange results. Enabling **--process** also changes the appearance of rolls, for example by removing the yellow background, and enables the **--showaverage**, **--button**, and **--send** options.\n\n* The option **--showaverage** (requires **--process**) will add an extra line at the end showing an average of all rolls.\n\n* The option **--button [Name] [Command]** (requires **--process**) will add an API command button to the end of the roll output with name **[Name]** and command **[Command]**. A tilde (~) inside the command will be replaced by double dashes (--) in order not to interfere with GroupCheck's syntax. You can use the results of the roll inside the command as follows: the string **IDS([sep])** will be replaced by the token ids used in the roll, joined by **[sep]**. The string **RESULTS([sep])** will be replaced by the results of the rolls (first roll for each token only), joined by **[sep]**. For example, if you want a comma-separated list of token ids, use **IDS(,)**.\n\n* The option **--raw [subheader]** will send a second version of the results to chat (always publicly, not whispered), which only shows the dice rolls for the tokens, without modifiers. Optionally, you can specifiy the subheader here, which will work like **--subheader**, except that it is only shown in the raw version. Requires **--process**.\n\n* The option **--send [Command]** option will send **[Command]** to chat as a separate message. It allows the same replacement of **RESULTS** and **IDS** as **--button** does, and is intended for sending API commands containing the results of the roll.\n\n* The option **--input [input0],[input1]...** will allow you to replace parts of a formula on-the-fly (for example, via roll queries). If the string INPUT_i is present in the roll's formula, it will be replaced by your i-th input (undefined INPUT\\_i will just be removed). This is meant to be able to easily DCs, target numbers, and the like.\n\n* The option **--usecharname**, resp. **--usetokenname**, control if the name of the token or the name of the character is displayed in front of the roll result. You can use e.g. the TokenNameNumber script to give different tokens for the same character different (numbered) names, allowing you to discern which of the tokens rolled which roll, even if there are several tokens representing the same character. This is active by default.\n\n* It is possible to alter the specific way rolls are made. There are 5 options: roll normally, roll with advantage, roll with disadvantage, always roll 2 times for every token, or (for the 5E Shaped sheet only) respect the roll setting on the sheet for selected tokens.

      "mdowninstructions": "<h1>GroupCheck</h1>\n\n<p>This is an API script meant to run checks for several tokens at once. You can specify the type of check to run and it will roll it once for every selected token. Note that you <strong>will</strong> have to configure the script and import the right types of checks before you can use it.</p>\n\n<h2>Basic usage</h2>\n\n<p>Having configured some checks, you can call the script using the following syntax</p>\n\n<pre><code>!group-check [--options] --Check Command\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here, you can supply zero or more options (see the section on options for specifics) that modify what exactly is rolled. <strong>Check Command</strong> is the command associated to the check you want to run. If no valid <strong>Check Command</strong> is supplied, a list of valid commands (in the form of API buttons) is instead output to chat, allowing you to press them to roll the corresponding check.<br/>\n<strong>Check Command</strong> will then be rolled once for every selected token that represents a character, and the result will be output to chat.</p>\n\n<h3>Example</h3>\n\n<p>Suppose that we are using D&amp;D 5E, and want to roll a Dexterity saving throw for every selected token, outputting the result to the GM only. The command would be</p>\n\n<pre><code>!group-check --whisper --Dexterity Save\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Note that this only works after having imported the right data for the sheet you are using.</p>\n\n<p>If you have two tokens selected, representing the characters <strong>Sarah</strong> and <strong>Mark</strong>, the script will output (with default settings)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Sarah:</strong> [[d20 + @{Sarah|dexterity_saving_throw_mod}]]</p>\n\n<p><strong>Mark:</strong> [[d20 + @{Mark|dexterity_saving_throw_mod}]]</p>\n\n<p>Internally, the form of the check is proscribed by a formula; the formula in this case is of the form &quot;[[d20 + @{dexterity_saving_throw_mod}]]&quot;, and the script will fill in the right attribute in place of &quot;@{dexterity_saving_throw_mod}&quot;.</p>\n\n<h2>Configuration</h2>\n\n<p>The script is designed to be easily configured to your specific system&#39;s needs. You can configure the script using the <strong>!group-check-config</strong> command. <strong>!group-check-config</strong> accepts the following options:</p>\n\n<h3>Show options</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>!group-check-config --show</strong> will display the current list of checks and the default options for GroupCheck.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Manipulating the check database</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>!group-check-config --import [Name]</strong> imports a predefined set of checks and adds them to the list. Currently, the available choices for <strong>[Name]</strong> are <strong>5E-Shaped</strong>, <strong>5E-OGL</strong>, <strong>Pathfinder-Official</strong>,<strong>Pathfinder-Community</strong>, and <strong>3.5</strong>.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>!group-check-config --add [JSON]</strong>  adds a check, or several checks, to the list of checks in the database. <strong>[JSON]</strong> must be valid JSON in the following format:</p>\n\n<p>{ &quot;Check Command&quot; : { &quot;name&quot; : &quot;Check Name&quot;, &quot;formula&quot; : &quot;FORMULA&quot;} }<br/>\nHere, the command will be called by <strong>!group-check --Check Command</strong>, the title of the box appearing in chat will be Check Name, and FORMULA is the formula used to calculate the roll result. Attributes to be filled in in FORMULA need to be specified as \\at{name}; inline roll brackets (&quot;[[&quot; or &quot;]]&quot;) should be replaced by &quot;\\[&quot;, respectively &quot;\\]&quot;. For example, to add a check with command Strength that roll a d20 + the character&#39;s Strength attribute, you would type</p>\n\n<p>!group-check-config --add { &quot;Strength&quot; : { &quot;name&quot; : &quot;Strength Test&quot;, &quot;formula&quot; : &quot;[d20 + \\at{Strength}]&quot;} }</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>!group-check-config --delete [Command]</strong> will delete the check called <strong>Command</strong> from the database.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>!group-check-config --clear</strong> will empty the list of checks in the database.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Manipulating default options</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>!group-check-config --set option value</strong> will set <strong>option</strong> to <strong>value</strong>. The following options are available: <strong>ro</strong>, <strong>die_adv</strong>, <strong>die_dis</strong>, <strong>fallback</strong>, and <strong>globalmod</strong>. To find out more about what these options do, consult the Options sections.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>!group-check-config --set option</strong> will set <strong>option</strong> (this is the variant for options which can be either true or false). The following options are available: <strong>showformula</strong>, <strong>hideformula</strong>, <strong>whisper</strong>, <strong>public</strong>, <strong>usecharname</strong>, <strong>usetokenname</strong>, <strong>showpicture</strong>, and <strong>hidepicture</strong>, <strong>direct</strong> and <strong>process</strong>. To find out more about what these options do, consult the Options section.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>!group-check-config --defaults</strong> will reset all options to the factory defaults.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>!group-check-config --reset</strong> will both empty the list of checks and reset all options.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Options</h2>\n\n<p>Most of the following options can be supplied in two ways: you can either supply them on the command line, or change the defaults via !group-check-config. Most of the time, it is probably advisable to do the latter.</p>\n\n<h3>Targeting</h3>\n\n<p>By default, the script will be run for every selected token. Alternatively, if the <strong>--ids IDs</strong> option is specified, it will instead run for every token in <strong>IDs</strong>, which is supplied in the form of a comma-separated list of token IDs. This shouldn&#39;t normally be necessary, but it could be useful for generating GroupCheck commands via an API script.</p>\n\n<h3>List of options</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>The options <strong>die_adv</strong>, and <strong>die_dis</strong> control the die substitution for disadvantage and advantage. The first d20 in the roll formula will be replaced by the value of die_adv resp. die_dis if the roll option adv for Advantage or dis for Disadvantage is specified.</p></li>\n<li><p>The options <strong>whisper</strong>, resp. <strong>public</strong>, control if rolls are whispered to the GM or output publicly.</p></li>\n<li><p>You can use the option <strong>--title [text]</strong> to display <strong>[text]</strong> instead of the normal title of the roll.</p></li>\n<li><p>You can use the option <strong>--subheader [text]</strong> to display <strong>[text]</strong> below the title of your roll.</p></li>\n<li><p>The options <strong>--direct</strong> and <strong>--process</strong> let GroupCheck use the rolls in two very different ways (you probably want to set this option via !group-check-config permanently instead of specifying it for every roll). <strong>--direct</strong> is the default, and equals the behaviour of GroupCheck prior to version 1.0, in that it simply outputs inline rolls to chat. On the other hand, <strong>--process</strong> lets GroupCheck process the results first to change their appearance and pass on the results to other scripts. Since <strong>--process</strong> has not been tested for many cases yet, this could lead to strange results. Enabling <strong>--process</strong> also changes the appearance of rolls, for example by removing the yellow background, and enables the <strong>--showaverage</strong>, <strong>--button</strong>, and <strong>--send</strong> options.</p></li>\n<li><p>The option <strong>--showaverage</strong> (requires <strong>--process</strong>) will add an extra line at the end showing an average of all rolls.</p></li>\n<li><p>The option <strong>--button [Name] [Command]</strong> (requires <strong>--process</strong>) will add an API command button to the end of the roll output with name <strong>[Name]</strong> and command <strong>[Command]</strong>. A tilde (~) inside the command will be replaced by double dashes (--) in order not to interfere with GroupCheck&#39;s syntax. You can use the results of the roll inside the command as follows: the string <strong>IDS([sep])</strong> will be replaced by the token ids used in the roll, joined by <strong>[sep]</strong>. The string <strong>RESULTS([sep])</strong> will be replaced by the results of the rolls (first roll for each token only), joined by <strong>[sep]</strong>. For example, if you want a comma-separated list of token ids, use <strong>IDS(,)</strong>.</p></li>\n<li><p>The option <strong>--raw [subheader]</strong> will send a second version of the results to chat (always publicly, not whispered), which only shows the dice rolls for the tokens, without modifiers. Optionally, you can specifiy the subheader here, which will work like <strong>--subheader</strong>, except that it is only shown in the raw version. Requires <strong>--process</strong>.</p></li>\n<li><p>The option <strong>--send [Command]</strong> option will send <strong>[Command]</strong> to chat as a separate message. It allows the same replacement of <strong>RESULTS</strong> and <strong>IDS</strong> as <strong>--button</strong> does, and is intended for sending API commands containing the results of the roll.</p></li>\n<li><p>The option <strong>--input [input0],[input1]...</strong> will allow you to replace parts of a formula on-the-fly (for example, via roll queries). If the string INPUT_i is present in the roll&#39;s formula, it will be replaced by your i-th input (undefined INPUT_i will just be removed). This is meant to be able to easily DCs, target numbers, and the like.</p></li>\n<li><p>The option <strong>--usecharname</strong>, resp. <strong>--usetokenname</strong>, control if the name of the token or the name of the character is displayed in front of the roll result. You can use e.g. the TokenNameNumber script to give different tokens for the same character different (numbered) names, allowing you to discern which of the tokens rolled which roll, even if there are several tokens representing the same character. This is active by default.</p></li>\n<li><p>It is possible to alter the specific way rolls are made. There are 5 options: roll normally, roll with advantage, roll with disadvantage, always roll 2 times for every token, or (for the 5E Shaped sheet only) respect the roll setting on the sheet for selected tokens. You can control this via the option <strong>--ro [Setting]</strong>, where <strong>[Setting]</strong> can be one of roll1, roll2, adv, dis, rollsetting, respectively. If you are not using D&amp;D 5th Edition, you probably want to leave this option on roll1 constantly.</p></li>\n<li><p>The option <strong>--globalmod [mod]</strong> will add <strong>[mod]</strong> as a modifier to all rolls made. Here <strong>[mod]</strong> can be any expression that the roll20 dice roller can interpret, such as a number, a die roll, a specific character&#39;s attribute, or a sum of these things.</p></li>\n<li><p>You can use <strong>--multi [n]</strong> to run every check <strong>[n]</strong> times instead of once, with a minimum of 1 time.</p></li>\n<li><p>It is possible to hide the formula for checks and only show the final result of the roll. This is controlled via the options <strong>--showformula</strong> and <strong>--hideformula</strong>.</p></li>\n<li><p>You can turn off the display of the token image next to the character name (it will always be displayed if the name is empty). This is controlled via the options <strong>--showpicture</strong> and <strong>--hidepicture</strong> (on by default).</p></li>\n<li><p>You can turn off the display of the name next to the token image. This is controlled via the options <strong>--showname</strong> and <strong>--hidename</strong> (on by default).</p></li>\n<li><p>You can supply a fallback value. When the option <strong>--fallback [value]</strong> is given, a roll will be made even for tokens not linked to a character; for these tokens, <strong>[value]</strong> will be used instead of the FIRST attribute in a roll, and all other attributes are treated as if they were 0. <strong>[value]</strong> may be any expression that the roll20 dice roller can interpret, such as a number, a die roll, a specific character&#39;s attribute, or a sum of these things. If also using <strong>--globalmod</strong>, the global modifier is applied in addition to the fallback mod.</p></li>\n<li><p>It is possible to supply a custom roll not present in the checks database. The syntax to do this is <strong>--custom CheckName, formula</strong>. This will roll a check with title <strong>CheckName</strong> and formula <strong>formula</strong> for the roll.</p></li>\n</ul>\n"

When multiple status FX are assigned to a token, it\rwill cycle through each one. Built-in and Custom FX are supported.\r\rFX are assigned to status markers through the One-Click user options for the\rscript. For each status marker that you want to assign a special FX to, just\renter the name of the special FX. If it is a beam-like effect (such as beam,\rbreath, splatter, or a custom effect whose definition has an angle of -1),\ralso enter the vector for the effect's direction in the form ```[X, Y]```.\rBeam-like effects can also be given a random vector with ```[random]```.\r\rNote: For most statuses, this script looks best using custom special FX with a\rshort range and fewer,smaller particles.\r\r### Examples:\r\r*green* ```bubbling-acid```\rCreates green bubbles on the token when the 'green' status marker is on.\r\r*red* ```splatter-blood [1, -2]```\rCreates a bleeding effect with blood spurting up and slightly to the right\rwhen the 'red' status marker is on.\r\r*death-zone* ```MyCustomEffect```\rCreates some sort of custom effect when the 'death-zone' status marker is on.\r\r*chemical-bolt* ```splatter-holy [random]```\rCreates a spark effect fired in a random direction when the 'chemical-bolt'\rstatus marker is on.\r\r*custom* ```sleep: glow-holy|stars: beam-fire [2,3]```\rExample of FX for CustomStatusMarkers.\rCreates FX for the custom status markers 'sleep' and 'stars'.\r\r## Help\r\rMy scripts are provided 'as-is', without warranty of any kind, expressed or implied.\r\rThat said, if you experience any issues while using this script,\rneed help using it, or if you have a neat suggestion for a new feature,\rplease shoot me a PM:\rhttps://app.roll20.net/users/46544/ada-l\r\rWhen messaging me about an issue, please be sure to include any error messages that\rappear in your API Console Log, any configurations you've got set up for the\rscript in the VTT, and any options you've got set up for the script on your\rgame's API Scripts page.

When multiple status FX are assigned to a token, it<br/>\nwill cycle through each one. Built-in and Custom FX are supported.</p>\n\n<p>FX are assigned to status markers through the One-Click user options for the<br/>\nscript. For each status marker that you want to assign a special FX to, just<br/>\nenter the name of the special FX. If it is a beam-like effect (such as beam,<br/>\nbreath, splatter, or a custom effect whose definition has an angle of -1),<br/>\nalso enter the vector for the effect&#39;s direction in the form <code>[X, Y]</code>.<br/>\nBeam-like effects can also be given a random vector with <code>[random]</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Note: For most statuses, this script looks best using custom special FX with a<br/>\nshort range and fewer,smaller particles.</p>\n\n<h3>Examples:</h3>\n\n<p><em>green</em> <code>bubbling-acid</code><br/>\nCreates green bubbles on the token when the &#39;green&#39; status marker is on.</p>\n\n<p><em>red</em> <code>splatter-blood [1, -2]</code><br/>\nCreates a bleeding effect with blood spurting up and slightly to the right<br/>\nwhen the &#39;red&#39; status marker is on.</p>\n\n<p><em>death-zone</em> <code>MyCustomEffect</code><br/>\nCreates some sort of custom effect when the &#39;death-zone&#39; status marker is on.</p>\n\n<p><em>chemical-bolt</em> <code>splatter-holy [random]</code><br/>\nCreates a spark effect fired in a random direction when the &#39;chemical-bolt&#39;<br/>\nstatus marker is on.</p>\n\n<p><em>custom</em> <code>sleep: glow-holy|stars: beam-fire [2,3]</code><br/>\nExample of FX for CustomStatusMarkers.<br/>\nCreates FX for the custom status markers &#39;sleep&#39; and &#39;stars&#39;.</p>\n\n<h2>Help</h2>\n\n<p>My scripts are provided &#39;as-is&#39;, without warranty of any kind, expressed or implied.</p>\n\n<p>That said, if you experience any issues while using this script,<br/>\nneed help using it, or if you have a neat suggestion for a new feature,<br/>\nplease shoot me a PM:<br/>\n<a href=\"https://app.roll20.net/users/46544/ada-l\">https://app.roll20.net/users/46544/ada-l</a></p>\n\n<p>When messaging me about an issue, please be sure to include any error messages that<br/>\nappear in your API Console Log, any configurations you&#39;ve got set up for the<br/>\nscript in the VTT, and any options you&#39;ve got set up for the script on your<br/>\ngame&#39;s API Scripts page.

        "description": "# Door Knocker v1.1\r___\rWelcome to Door Knocker. This script helps quickly open and close doors by controlling the dynamic lighting lines. If you have any questions, comments, or find a bug; please drop by the [Door Knocker forum thread](https://app.roll20.net/forum/post/7698809/script-door-knocker).\r### Using Door Knocker\rThe script will move dynamic lighting lines used as doors to the map layer and make them transparent, opening the door. It determines what is a door and a wall based on the stroke color of the polygon and will only open doors within 1 square (default 70px) of the door knocker token.\r### Basic Command Syntax\rThe script uses a standardized API command syntax. All Door Knocker commands will begin with **!knock**. This will then be followed bya space a double dash preceding a keyword and options group. This looks like this:\r**!knock --keyWord|option1|option2|...**\r### Opening and Closing Doors\rOpen and close using the **key** or **push** keyword followed by an option to tell the script whether to open doors, close doors, or toggle doors. You can also pass an optional second option to tell the script to open/close/toggle all doors within range of the knocker token, on the page, or in the campaign. These commands look like:\r**!knock --key/push|open/close/toggle|all/page/campaign**\r- **key/push:** This is the keyword that tells the script to manipulate door dynamic lighting lines. The **key** keyword operates on both locked and unlocked doors and is GM only. The **push** keyword only operates on unlocked doors.\r- **open/close/toggle/reveal/hide/togglehide/anyopen/anyclose/anytoggle:** This option tells the script to open, close, or toggle (open closed doors and close open doors) the closest door (or all doors if also using the all option described below). Reveal, hide, and togglehide cause the command to work on hidden doors instead and only work with the **key** keyword. anyopen, anyclose, and anytoggle work on all types of doors and only work with the **key** keyword.\r- **all/page/campaign:** *Optional argument* This option tells the script to operate on all doors within range, all doors on a page, or all doors in the campaign. The **page** and **campaign** keywords are GM only and do not work with the **push** keyword.\r\r### Setting up the Door Knocker\rSet the wall, door, and locked door stroke colors in the settings menu using hex color codes (e.g. #000000). You can also set these values by selecting an already created DL line. This functionality is only accessible to the GM. The command syntax for using a selected DL line looks like:\r**!knock --preset|wall/door/unlocked/hidden/farAura/closeAura|hex color**\r- **preset:** This is the keyword that tells the script to change it's settings\r- **wall/door/unlocked/farAura/closeAura:** This option tells the script to update the color setting for walls, doors, unlocked doors, and close and far door detection\r- **hex color:** *Optional argument* Passing a hex color here will set the script to consider all polygons on the Dynamic Lighting layer with a stroke of this color to be doors/walls. If this option is not passed the script will look for a selected polygon to pull a stroke color from.\r\r### Setting up your maps\rThe only map setup needed is to ensure your dynamic lighting doors are the appropriate color.  This functionality is only accessible to the GM. If you are adapting a module or add-onto an already existing door color scheme you can select a door line and run the following chat command:\r**!knock --adapt|door/wall/unlocked/hidden|campaign**\r- **adapt:** This is the keyword that tells the script to update all polygons on the dynamic lighting layer with the same stroke color as the selected polygon(s) to have the script's door/wall stroke color\r- **wall/door/unlocked:** This option tells the script to update the stroke color to that of walls, doors, or unlocked doors\r- **campaign:** *Optional argument* adding this optional argument tells the script to update polygons on all pages, not just the current page.\r\r### Searching for Doors\rBy default the script will create two auras around the door knocker token when a door is with in range. Aura 1 will display the range to the closest door while aura 2 will display the range to the furthest door. You can customize what color these auras are from the settings menu on this character. You can also turn the feature can off (or back on) from there as well. It is also possible to generate these auras on other tokens by selecting them and running the following command:\r**!knock --search|on/off**\r- **search:** This is the keyword that tells the script turn on or off aura detection of nearby walls for the selected token(s)\r- **on/off:** *Optional argument* Adding this optional argument will tell the script to only turn on or off aura detection. When omitted the script will toggle aura detection instead.\r\rUsing this feature will still allow you to use your token's auras as you wish because the aura is actually created on an invisible token that is slaved to the selected token.\r### Customizing the Script\r#### Door knocker token\rThe script uses a generic key token as the door knocker token. You can customize this by changing the default token of this character.\r#### Script created abilities\rThe script also creates six abilities on this character as token actions. These can be disabled as token actions, but should not be deleted as the script will simply remake them. You can also add whatever other macros you want to this character.\r### Attributions\rThe default token image is from [https://game-icons.net/](https://game-icons.net/) under the [creative commons license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/#).

You can also pass an optional second option to tell the script to open/close/toggle all doors within range of the knocker token, on the page, or in the campaign. These commands look like:<br/>\n<strong>!knock --key/push|open/close/toggle|all/page/campaign</strong><br/>\n- <strong>key/push:</strong> This is the keyword that tells the script to manipulate door dynamic lighting lines. The <strong>key</strong> keyword operates on both locked and unlocked doors and is GM only. The <strong>push</strong> keyword only operates on unlocked doors.<br/>\n- <strong>open/close/toggle/reveal/hide/togglehide/anyopen/anyclose/anytoggle:</strong> This option tells the script to open, close, or toggle (open closed doors and close open doors) the closest door (or all doors if also using the all option described below). Reveal, hide, and togglehide cause the command to work on hidden doors instead and only work with the <strong>key</strong> keyword. anyopen, anyclose, and anytoggle work on all types of doors and only work with the <strong>key</strong> keyword.<br/>\n- <strong>all/page/campaign:</strong> <em>Optional argument</em> This option tells the script to operate on all doors within range, all doors on a page, or all doors in the campaign. The <strong>page</strong> and <strong>campaign</strong> keywords are GM only and do not work with the <strong>push</strong> keyword.</p>\n\n<h3>Setting up the Door Knocker</h3>\n\n<p>Set the wall, door, and locked door stroke colors in the settings menu using hex color codes (e.g. #000000). You can also set these values by selecting an already created DL line. This functionality is only accessible to the GM. The command syntax for using a selected DL line looks like:<br/>\n<strong>!knock --preset|wall/door/unlocked/hidden/farAura/closeAura|hex color</strong><br/>\n- <strong>preset:</strong> This is the keyword that tells the script to change it&#39;s settings<br/>\n- <strong>wall/door/unlocked/farAura/closeAura:</strong> This option tells the script to update the color setting for walls, doors, unlocked doors, and close and far door detection<br/>\n- <strong>hex color:</strong> <em>Optional argument</em> Passing a hex color here will set the script to consider all polygons on the Dynamic Lighting layer with a stroke of this color to be doors/walls. If this option is not passed the script will look for a selected polygon to pull a stroke color from.</p>\n\n<h3>Setting up your maps</h3>\n\n<p>The only map setup needed is to ensure your dynamic lighting doors are the appropriate color.  This functionality is only accessible to the GM. If you are adapting a module or add-onto an already existing door color scheme you can select a door line and run the following chat command:<br/>\n<strong>!knock --adapt|door/wall/unlocked/hidden|campaign</strong><br/>\n- <strong>adapt:</strong> This is the keyword that tells the script to update all polygons on the dynamic lighting layer with the same stroke color as the selected polygon(s) to have the script&#39;s door/wall stroke color<br/>\n- <strong>wall/door/unlocked:</strong> This option tells the script to update the stroke color to that of walls, doors, or unlocked doors<br/>\n- <strong>campaign:</strong> <em>Optional argument</em> adding this optional argument tells the script to update polygons on all pages, not just the current page.</p>\n\n<h3>Searching for Doors</h3>\n\n<p>By default the script will create two auras around the door knocker token when a door is with in range. Aura 1 will display the range to the closest door while aura 2 will display the range to the furthest door. You can customize what color these auras are from the settings menu on this character. You can also turn the feature can off (or back on) from there as well. It is also possible to generate these auras on other tokens by selecting them and running the following command:<br/>\n<strong>!knock --search|on/off</strong><br/>\n- <strong>search:</strong> This is the keyword that tells the script turn on or off aura detection of nearby walls for the selected token(s)<br/>\n- <strong>on/off:</strong> <em>Optional argument</em> Adding this optional argument will tell the script to only turn on or off aura detection. When omitted the script will toggle aura detection instead.</p>\n\n<p>Using this feature will still allow you to use your token&#39;s auras as you wish because the aura is actually created on an invisible token that is slaved to the selected token.</p>\n\n<h3>Customizing the Script</h3>\n\n<h4>Door knocker token</h4>\n\n<p>The script uses a generic key token as the door knocker token. You can customize this by changing the default token of this character.</p>\n\n<h4>Script created abilities</h4>\n\n<p>The script also creates six abilities on this character as token actions. These can be disabled as token actions, but should not be deleted as the script will simply remake them. You can also add whatever other macros you want to this character.</p>\n\n<h3>Attributions</h3>\n\n<p>The default token image is from <a href=\"https://game-icons.net/\">https://game-icons.net/</a> under the <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/#\">creative commons license</a>. Thanks to Keith Curtis for finding this awesome token.</p>\n"

Since it's designed to take information generated by a script, there wouldn't be any reason you'd want to manually enter these commands.  See the [Walls forum post](https://app.roll20.net/forum/permalink/1337473/) for full details of how to export paths from The GIMP.\n\nYou can load your exported SVG into the [Walls SVG parser](http://roll20api.net) to turn it into walls commands.  You shouldn't need to edit the commands manually, but you might decide to change the color or width later so they are documented below.  Once you've loaded your walls commands, be sure you have the corresponding graphic selected on the map layer before you execute the commands.  The more complicated the map, the longer it will take to parse and draw.  You should see occasional updates to chat as it works through the paths.  A minute or so is not completely unheard of.\n\n## Commands\n\n```!walls <operation details>``` (**GM Only**)\n\n### Operations\n* `begin` -- This instructs walls to start accumulating data on a new wall.\n* `viewbox <width> <height>` -- This tells walls the scale to use for the path data it will receive.\n* `strokecolor <color>` -- This sets the color for lines generated from this import.  The format is `#RRGGBB`, an HTML color.\n* `fillcolor <color>` -- This sets the color for lines generated from this import. Usually you'll want to leave this as `transparent`, but you can also specify a color in the format `#RRGGBB`, an HTML color.\n* `strokewidth <number>` -- This sets the width for lines generated from this import.  This should be a number greater than 0 but not more than 100.  Decimals like 2.5 are just fine.\n* `moveto <x> <y>` -- Moves the line start point to (x,y) relative to the view box.\n* `curveto <x1> <y1> <x2> <y2> <x> <y>` -- Creates a Bézier curve from the current point to (x,y) using (x1,y1) as the starting control point and (x2,y2) as the ending control point.\n* `end` -- This instructs walls that all path data has been input and it's time to draw all the lines based on the data.\n\n\n```!walls-gmnotes``` (**GM Only**)\n\n### Description\nThis version reads `!walls` commands from the GM Notes field of a token.  Copy/paste the output from the Walls SVG parser into the GM Notes on the map graphic, then with it selected run this command to import the walls for it.

It's great for hex-based\rmaps where the PCs must explore and discover each area hex by hex.\r\r## General Usage\r\rThis script's actions and configurations are accessible through its menu\rdisplayed in the chat (Visible only to the GM).\rTo open the script's menu, activate the 'Hexploration_menu' macro installed\rby the script.\r\rNote that this script only works for maps whose grid types are set to either\r'Hex (V)' or 'Hex (H)'. The opaque hexes will be aligned to the page's hex\rgrid.\r\rWhen you move a token representing a character into an area concealed by a hex,\rthe hex will be revealed. If the script's reveal distance is set greater than 0,\rthen adjacent hexes out to that distance (in hex units) will also be revealed.\r\rWatch https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Roll20/roll20-api-scripts/master/Hexploration/Hexploration.gif\rfor a short demo of the basics of how the script works.\r\r### Rendering Hexes\r\rTo create a hex-filled area, first draw one or more polygons containing the\rarea you want filled with hexes. Then select the polygons and press the\r'Fill Polygon' action from the script's menu. That's it!\r\r### Naming Hexes\r\rHexes can be named to represent locations that are concealing. The names of\rthe hexes will be shown on the GM layer, invisible to the PCs. When a named\rhex is revealed, it will announce that its location has been discovered in the\rchat.\r\rThere are two ways to name locations hidden by hexes:\r\rBefore rendering the hexes using the 'Fill Polygon' action, create named tokens\rwith the 'white-tower' status representing the locations you want to conceal\rwith the hexes. This will also set the icon for the hex to that of the named\rtoken.\r\rTo name a hex that's already been rendered, select the hex and set its name\rusing the 'Name Hex' action from the menu.\r\r### Setting a Hex's Icon\r\rHexes can be assigned a named icon. The icon will be hidden on the GM layer,\rand it and its name will be revealed when its hex is revealed.\r\rTo make a hex with an icon, create a named token with the 'white-tower' status\rrepresenting the location you want to conceal within a hex. Then fill the area\rcontaining that token with hexes. It will be automatically concealed and\rassigned to the hex it was in.\r\r## Actions\r\rThe script contains the following actions available from the script's chat menu:\r\r### Fill Polygon\r\rThis renders hexes within one more more polygon areas.\rSelect one or more polygons, then use this action to fill their areas with\rhexes.\r\r### Inverse Fill\r\rThis works like the 'Fill Polygon' action, except that it renders hexes\reverywhere on the page except inside the selected polygons' areas instead.\r\r### Name Hex\r\rThis allows you to name a hex after it has been rendered. Select the hex you\rwant to name, then use this action to specify a name for it.\r\r## Configurations\r\rThe script contains the following configurations that can be set from the\rscript's chat menu:\r\r### Drawing configs\r\rThese configurations set properties for hexes as you are drawing them.\r\r#### Hex Color\r\rThis allows you to specify the color, border color, and label color of hexes.\r\r#### Border Width\r\rThis sets the width of the border outlines on hexes.\r\r#### Hex Reveal Distance\r\rIf this is set, then a character can only reveal the hexes being drawn if they\rare within the specified number of hexes away from them.\r\rE.g., if a hex is drawn while this config is set to 3, then a character must be\rwithin 3 hexes from it to reveal it. The hex will not be revealed if the\rcharacter is 4 or more hexes away from it, even if the global reveal distance\ris set very high.\r\rIf this is not set, then the hex can be revealed from a theoretically infinite\rdistance away (out to the line of sight distance).\r\r### Global configs\r\rThese configs apply globally throughout the use of this script.\r\r#### Line of Sight\r\rThis is the global reveal distance. It specifies how far out (in units) hexes\rare revealed when a character token is moved.\r\r## Help\r\rMy scripts are provided 'as-is', without warranty of any kind, expressed or implied.\r\rThat said, if you experience any issues while using this script,\rneed help using it, or if you have a neat suggestion for a new feature,\rplease shoot me a PM:\rhttps://app.roll20.net/users/46544/ada-l\r\rWhen messaging me about an issue, please be sure to include any error messages that\rappear in your API Console Log, any configurations you've got set up for the\rscript in the VTT, and any options you've got set up for the script on your\rgame's API Scripts page.

        "description": "# Page Navigator v2.0\nPage Navigator allows you to more easily move your players from page to page. Movement can be triggered by chat command or token movement. The script will also handle creation of tokens on the new page for moved players.\n## Movement Commands & Token Setup\n### Chat Triggered page change:\nAll players, only those currently in the player ribbon, or specific players can be moved to any page in the game, or returned to the player ribbon.\nThe basic syntax for a move command is:\n`!nav --move,page=PAGENAME,landing=LANDINGTEXT|whole/current/characterid|characterid|characterid|...`\n### Token movement triggered page change:\nUsing this function requires that destination tokens be set up. Whenever a token controlled by a player ends its movement on a destination token, a chat prompt is sent to ask if the character should be moved to the page linked to that destination token or not. The prompt is sent to players only if the destination page is contained in a page folder that players have been given unrestricted access to. See the **Other Options** section below for more information about folders.\nIn order to setup a destination token, the token must be named the same as the page to which it links with the exception of any folder names the page has been tagged with.\n### Token Teleportation:\nWhen moving players to a page, the script can create tokens for each player at a destination token. The default characters to create tokens for for each player can be set in the config menu.\nIn order for teleportation to function, destination tokens (from above) must contain a JSON in their GM notes field of the following format:\n```\n{\n    &#34;landingLocation&#34;:&#34;Location text of linked token&#34;, <=- Optional\n    &#34;location&#34;:&#34;Location text&#34;, <=- Optional\n    &#34;chat&#34;:&#34;Chat message/API command to send when moving to this destination token&#34;, <=- Optional\n    &#34;polygon&#34;:[&#34;Array of polygons limiting token generation&#34;] <=- Only needed if location text is entered\n}\n```\nYou can setup destination tokens by using the Destination Token Setup Wizard via the command `!nav --setup`. You must have a token selected when you enter the command.\n## Miscellaeneous Commands and Other Functions\n* `!nav --config` Brings up the config menu.\n* Folders are designated by tagging pages with whatever folder name you would like enclosed in square brackets (e.g. [FolderName]). Each folder name should be in its own set of square brackets. Any time you reference a page by name for the script, do not incude the folder tags in the name. The script automatically creates two folders, an **All** folder (which pages do not need to be tagged with) and a **Players** folder which can be used to tag pages as with any other folder name. Access restrictions for folders can be set in the config menu. If a page is contained in any folder that has player access, players will be able to send themselves to that page and any destinations therein without GM approval.\n* When teleportation is enabled an additional option will be created in the config menu to automatically remove other tokens for teleporting players before creating new tokens for them.\n## Example Use Cases\nAssuming pages named Scrapwall [Numeria][Scrapwall] with locations of &#34;Clockwork Chapel&#34;(LinkLocation:entrance) and &#34;Raider Hideout&#34;(LinkLocation:entrance), Clockwork Chapel[Numeria][Scrapwall] with a location of &#34;entrance&#34;(linkLocation:&#34;Clockwork Chapel&#34;), and Raider Hideout with a location of &#34;entrance&#34;(linkLocation:&#34;Raider Hideout&#34;). And characters named Jonos,Kindle, and Violet.\n* Move player(s) controlling Jonos to Raider Hideout:\n`!nav --move,page=Raider Hideout|@{Jonos|character_id}`\n* Move as before and create default token(s) for the player(s):\n`!nav --move,page=Raider Hideout,landing=entrance|@{Jonos|character_id}`\n* Return Jonos to the player ribbon:\n`!nav --move,page=return|@{Jonos|character_id}`\n* Return as before, but query where to generate a token:\n`!nav --move,page=return,landing=?|@{Jonos|character_id}`\n## Full Command Syntax Guide\nThis is the full guide of the chat commands available. Syntax is given with optional arguments enclosed in square brackets (e.g. Required Argument vs. [Optional Argument]). Mutually exclusive arguments are separated by a forward slash (/), do not include these brackets when sending actual commands to the script.\n* Move Command:\n`!nav --move,[page=PAGENAME/pageID=pageid],[landing=LOCATIONTEXT/?]|[PLAYERNAME/PLAYERID/CHARACTERID]|[PLAYERNAME/PLAYERID/CHARACTERID]|...`\n  * **page=PAGENAME:** The page name, without the folder tags, of the page to move to. If the command is sent by a player, itwill be ignored if the page is not contained within a player accessible folder.\n  * **pageID=PAGEID:** The page id of the page to move to. This will probably only be used by the script itself or other APIs as there is no way for users to access the page id.\n  * **landing=LOCATIONTEXT:** This is the location text of the token where tokens should be created. If a **?** is entered as the location text, a menu prompt will be sent to the messaging player to ask what destination to use.\n  * **PLAYERNAME/PLAYERID/CHARACTERID:** The player name, player ID, or character ID to be moved.\n  * If no page is specified a prompt will be sent to the messaging player to ask what page to send players to.\n  * If no player or character is specified the command will not be processed.\n* Configuration Option Controls:\n`!nav --config,[remove=on/off],[teleport=on/off],[folder=FOLDERNAME,access=gm/players],[control=whole/current/self],[dmarker=statusmarker name/name only]`\n  * If no additional options are entered, then the config menu will be displayed. Will only use the first of these the script encounters.\nremove: This sets token removal on or off. Token removal causes all other instances of tokens representing teleporting characters to be removed before creating new tokens at a designated destination token.\n  * **folder:** Designates what folder that you would like to change the access state of. Folder access information is stored in the Page Navigator character in an ability called Page Folders.\n  * **access:** This sets player access for the indicated folder.\n  * **control:** Sets player's ability to move others to new pages (whole=all players, current party=only those currently on the player toolbar, self=only themselves).\n  * **dmarker:** Sets what status marker is used to define destination tokens. Can be the name of a statusmarker or **name**. If **name** will only look for tokens that are named the same as a page.\n  * **teleport:** Sets token teleportation on/off.\n* Destination Token Setup Wizard:\n`!nav --setup`\n**Wizard Buttons:**\n  * **Token Name:** Clicking this button will bring up a query with options for the names of all current pages. You can also enter the name of yet to be created name by selecting the **PAGE NOT CREATED YET** option\n  * **Boundary:** Select polygonal paths that you want to use to bound the token creation area for the destination token and then click this button. All polygons selected should create a closed shape as the script determines whether tokens can be created from a destination via a flood-fill algorithm.\n  * **Location Text:** Clicking this button will bring up a query similar to that of the Token Name for selecting or entering custom text to describe the location of this destination.\n  * **linkLocation Text:** As the button for Location text, but describes the location of the destination token this token links to.\n  * **Chat Command:** Allows you to enter a line of text to be sent to chat when players are moved to this destination. Can be used to have the script send API commands based on party movement.",

The script can be used with either just basic functionality to simply draw AoE regions, or can utilize a host of subcommands to define damage, saving throws, chat output, etc., detecting creatures within affected squares and either rolling saving throws and/or applying damage and condition markers automatically (ala GroupCheck or similar script), or as a deferred action by clicking buttons on the chat interface.</p>\n\n<p><strong>WIKI DOCUMENTATION</strong><br/>\nFull documentation can be found on the wiki page <a href=\"https://wiki.roll20.net/SmartAoE\">here</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>FORUM LINK:</strong><br/>\nFor more information and discussion please visit the forum thread <a href=\"https://app.roll20.net/forum/post/10485883/script-smartaoe-graphical-interface-for-implementing-aoes-on-gridded-maps/?pageforid=10485883#post-10485883\">here</a></p>\n<div id='patreon-link' class='alert alert-info'><div style='float: left; width: 80px;'><a target='_blank' href='https://www.patreon.com/djmoorehead'><img src='https://app.roll20.net/images/patreon_logo.png'></a></div><div style='margin-left: 100px;'>You can support development of this script by contributing to the <a target='_blank' href='https://www.patreon.com/djmoorehead'>Patreon Campaign</a> of the author. <div style='font-size: 0.9em;'>This Patreon campaign is not affiliated with Roll20; as such, contributions are voluntary and Roll20 cannot provide support or refunds for contributions.</div></div></div>"

I came up with this. This is the first Beta release, and is probably still prone to bugs. Let me know if you have any troubles/suggestions. ```  SyncPage gives you a way to sync pages. If an object is created, changed or removed on one of the synced pages, it will also be on the others. It also has commands to hide/show specific tokens on different synced pages, which gives you a way to hide/show certain tokens for players by dragging a player to another synced page.  Due to API limitations, only tokens with an image that is in your library will be added with that image on the synced page(s), tokens with images not in your library will get the default token image.\n### How It Works\n ``` NOTE: I wanted to do this automatically, but at the moment Roll20 doesn't allow the creation of pages through the API. ```  You create a new page with exactly the same name as the page you want to sync, and give it a '_synced' prefix, eg.:  ![Page Sync Demo](https://i.imgur.com/VAPEBy4.png \"Page Sync Demo\")  The initial page will be synced (with all objects on it) to the newly created page, and everything that changes on one of the pages will now also change on the other pages. After this you can bring up the `SyncPage Menu` by using the `!sync` command, eg.:  ![Menu](https://i.imgur.com/ZvAtEtM.png \"Menu\")  With this menu you can hide/show specific tokens on the different synced pages.  ``` NOTE: A token with the \"Show Here\" or \"Hide Here\" flag will always go before doing \"Show on Other pages\" or \"Hide on Other pages\" ```  Now you can drag specific players to one of the synced maps to show them only the things they need to see.  ![Player Demo](https://i.imgur.com/o1cCyEZ.png \"Player Demo\")\n\n ### Config\n\n ![Config Menu](https://i.imgur.com/SxLZPWr.png \"Config Menu\")  \n* **Command** - The command you want to use for this script. \n* **Reload Refresh** - Refresh the synced pages on a reload. \n* **True Copy** - Will really duplicate the page, with all tokens, drawings, texts, etc. If enabled it will trigger on duplicating a page.  \n\n### Commands\n  * **!sync** - Shows the SyncPage Menu. \n* **!sync config** - Shows the config menu. \n* **!sync show** - Sets the `show here` flag to the selected token(s). \n* **!sync hide** - Sets the `hide here` flag to the selected token(s). \n* **!sync show others** - Sets the `show others` flag to the selected token(s). \n* **!sync hide others** - Sets the `hide others` flag to the selected token(s).  \n\n#### Changelog\n\n **28-04-2018 - 0.1.9** \n* Added a \"true copy\" feature.

        "description": "# 5E Resting in Style\n\nThis script for the 5E OGL character sheet solves the error prone task of updating your character sheet when resting. Using !long-rest and !short-rest commands will update your sheet, and report to you everything it is doing.\n\n## Short rest\n\nSelect your character, then run the `!short-rest` command. It will:\n\n- check your hit points and hit dice, and remind you to use them if needed.\n\n- replenish Warlock **Pact Magic** spell slots. This works correctly even if you\n  are a multiclass spell caster.\n\n- replenish class specific resources, like **Wild Shape**, **Second Wind** and **Channel Divinity**.\n\n    - It knows that Bards regain **Bardic Inspiration** at class level 5.\n\n    - It knows that Sorcerers gain 4 Sorcery Points at class level 20.\n\n- replenish subclass specific resources, like **Superiority Dice** and **Hexblade's Curse**.\n\n- remind Wizards to use **Arcane Recovery**, and Bards to use **Song of Rest**.\n\n- turn off global modifiers with a short duration, like **Bless**, **Sacred Weapon** and **Shield of Faith**.\n\n## Long rest\n\nSelect your character, then run the `!long-rest` command. It will:\n\n- replenish your hit points.\n\n- replenish the correct number of hit dice (even at lvl 1).\n\n- remove temporary hit points.\n\n- reduce exhaustion level.\n\n- replenish spell slots.\n\n- replenish class specific resources, like **Lay on Hands**, **Arcane Recovery** and **Rage**.\n\n- replenish subclass specific resources, like **Consult the Spirits** and **Avenging Angel**.\n\n- replenish race specific resources, like **Breath Weapon** and **Relentless Endurance**.\n\n- turn off global modifiers with long durations, like **Mage Armor**.\n\n## Usage\n\nResting in Style will generally do the right thing out of the box, as long as\nyou're using the 5th Edition OGL by Roll20 character sheet.\n\nHowever, not all resources are automatically added to the Resource boxes. You\nmight have to add them yourself.\n\nFor instance, a Wizard starts with the **Arcane Recovery** skill. This is not\ntracked in the sheet.

        "description": "\n\n# Roll20 Shaped Character Sheet Companion Script\nThis is a script designed for use with the API on the [Roll20 Virtual Table Top](http://roll20.net). This script is specifically designed to provide services and enhancements for the [5e Shaped Character Sheet](http://github.com/mlenser/roll20-character-sheets/tree/master/D%26D_5e_Reshaped) by Roll20 user Kryx. It **will not work** with any other character sheet such as the Roll20 5e OGL character sheet. If you report bugs/ask for help while trying to use the script with a different character sheet you will be ignored with extreme prejudice!\n\n**NOTE FOR 1-CLICK USERS**: I recommend that you do not install this script via the 1-Click interface. Both the script and the sheet it supports are under very active development with frequent updates. If you install them from the Roll20 sheet list/1-click script page, they will update automatically without asking you when a new version is released. If something goes wrong, this can leave your campaign in a mess just before you're due to start a game session. Even when upgrades go smoothly, you may decide that you don't like changes that have been made and prefer the old version. Unless you install a specific version of the sheet and the script, you will have no control over this process, and downgrades after the fact are hard-to-impossible. \n\n\n\n\n# Key features\n* Automatically create characters from Monster Manual statblock text\n* Import spells to characters from user-created databases of spells in JSON format\n* Import monsters from user-created databases in JSON format\n* Automatic population of NPC spells from JSON (if present) on import (both JSON and statblock)\n* Auto HP rolling on drop for monster tokens\n* Token setup with configurable defaults on monster import\n* Auto ammo decrement\n* Auto death save increment\n* Auto HD reduction/HP increase on HD roll\n* Advantage tracking commands - set a character to have (dis)advantage and mark which tokens this applies to\n* Commands to create token actions for new characters\n* Short/Long Rest handling\n* Trait use count decrementing\n* Automatic configuration of new characters\n\n# Setup\n## Prerequisites:\n* You, or the person who created your game, must be a **Pro** subscriber to Roll20 to use this script.\n* You should be familiar with [how to use roll20](https://app.roll20.net/editor/tutorial), have a basic understanding of how to [configure a game](https://wiki.roll20.net/Game_Management) on Roll20, including setting up [character sheets](https://wiki.roll20.net/Character_Sheets) and installing API scripts. If you've only just started using Roll20 and haven't found your feet yet, setting this script up and using it is probably a bad place to start - it's an advanced tool, many of whose features presume a good working understanding of standard Roll20 capabilities. Play around with a simple campaign first, get used to making characters, working with tokens, and using the 5e Shaped Character Sheet manually; and then come back here for power-user goodness.\n* You should have a recent version of the 5e Shaped Character Sheet. Due to the lack of versioning support with Roll20 character sheets, we **strongly** recommend that you install a specific version from [Kryx's Github](https://github.com/mlenser/roll20-character-sheets/tree/master/5eShaped). Instructions for how to do this can be found on the thread on the [character sheets forum](https://app.roll20.net/forum/category/277980) - the threads change frequently but at the time of writing the latest one was [here](https://app.roll20.net/forum/post/4450188/5e-shaped-version-8-plus). Although it is possible to install the character sheet from the list in game settings, we recommend that you don't do this for the reasons outlined at the beginning of this document.\n\n## Installation\n1. Open the [raw text of the script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/symposion/roll20-api-scripts/master/5eShapedCompanion/latest/5eShapedCompanion.js)\n1. Copy all the text - **Ctrl-A** followed by **Ctrl-C** (or **Cmd-A**, **Cmd-C** on a Mac)\n1. Got to the API scripts page for your campaign\n1. Paste the text into a new script, and then give it a sensible name in the box at the top - e.g. \"5e Shaped Companion\"\n1. Hit save\n1. When the page refreshes, check the console box at the bottom of the page to make sure that there are no errors. If\n everything has worked you should see a line that looks a bit like: `\"ShapedScripts 1460893071206 INFO :   -=> ShapedScripts v0.8.3 <=-\"`. If you see a line that includes the text `ERROR` then Something Bad Has Happened and you should ask for help on the API scripts forum if you can't work the problem out for yourself from the error message (sometimes they are even helpful, I promise!)\n\nYou are now set up and should be able to use the script as detailed below.\n\n## Updating\nSometimes a new version of the script comes out. If you have installed the script according to the instructions above, you will need to update it manually when this happens. The process is exactly the same as installing the original, except that when you paste the script into your campaign, you should **replace** the script text of the previous version rather than installing a new one. This is very important, because if you end up with two different versions of the script running at the same time, Bad Things Will Happen.\n\n## Optional Extras\nSome of the script commands allow you to import spells or monsters from custom data files. This way of importing can be faster and more customisable than dragging from the Compendium, and it's also extensible: you can add extra data files to add more content. The script comes with all the SRD monsters and spells built-in. Creating additional custom data files is beyond the scope of this README at the moment, but you may find pre-made files floating around on the internet made by other people if you search for them. These should be script files that end in .js (**not .json**), and you install them in exactly the same way that you install the main script. If it worked, you should see some lines like this in your API log:\n```\n\"ShapedScripts 1460893071585 INFO : Summary of adding entities to the lookup: {\\\"errors\\\":0,\\\"monsters\\\":{\\\"withErrors\\\":0,\\\"skipped\\\":0,\\\"deleted\\\":0,\\\"patched\\\":0,\\\"added\\\":558}}\"\n```\n\n# Usage\n## Import a Monster from Monster Manual Statblock text\nYou first of all need a statblock from somewhere - generally speaking people get these from PDFs of adventures, or perhaps an OCRed copy of the Monster Manual. The statblock must conform to the layout conventions used by WotC for their 5e products or it will not work; fortunately most published material respects these conventions. Once you have statblock, follow these steps:\n\n1. Create/find a token to represent your monster/character, and place it on the tabletop\n1. Open the token settings\n1. Paste your statblock into the GM notes for the token. Make sure that you haven't lost all of the linebreaks - the Roll20 text editor controls can be a bit funny about line-endings. Sometimes I have to paste the text into a text editor first, and then copy it out of there before I paste it into Roll20. It should look roughly like the original you copied it from, minus all the formatting. At this stage you might also want to check that it's not completely garbled, if e.g. it comes from an OCR scan of a print book. The script will fix a lot of mistakes, but it's still only a script - if the text is totally garbled you may need to fix some of the mistakes manually.\n1. When you're done, come out of the token editing and select the token.\n1. Type **!shaped-import-statblock** into the chat window and hit enter.\n1. You should see a message in the chat window, and end up with a new character in the journal. If you see an error\nmessage at this point you may need to fix up some problems with the text of the statblock\n\nYour new monster is now ready for use!\n\n### Notes on Statblock Text\nThe script does its best to fix up errors in the text and be tolerant of variances in layout, but there are some things\nthat it absolutely requires to be correct:\n\n* Character/monster name needs to be on its own line at the beginning\n* Sections headers like \"Actions\" and \"Reactions\" need to be the last thing on a line to be recognised (and preferably on a line on their own, although the parser usually deals with this ok)\n* Trait and action names need to be title case and end with a full stop, like in the MM.\n* Don't paste in descriptions at the bottom of the statblock - just the statblock proper. This is because actions can be multiline and there is no way of telling where a final multiline action ends and a description begins (see e.g. Priest in the MM - don't paste the final description paragraph in)\n\n## Importing Monsters from the Script Database\n### Manually\n\n1. Find a token for your new monster and place it on the tabletop\n1. Select the token\n1. Type **!shaped-import-monster --Lich** into the chat window and hit enter, replacing 'Lich' with the name of the monster you want to import. Obviously the monster name must match something in your database - which by default includes SRD monsters unless you've added additional data files. If you're not sure what names are present in the database, or exactly what spelling is being used, try the Guided approach mentioned immediately below.\n1. You should see a message in the chat window, and end up with a new character in the journal.\n\nYour new monster is now ready for use!\n\n### Guided\nWhen you run **!shaped-monsters** it will output a scrollable list of all of the monsters in the chat window, along with filter buttons to allow you to narrow the list down by things like type, CR, school, class, etc. Clicking a monster on this list will import it into your library. This script comes with all the SRD monsters and spells built in.\n\n## Importing Spells from the Script Database\n### Manually\n\n1. Select a token that represents a character\n1. Type **!shaped-import-spell --Fireball, Cure Wounds** into the chat window and hit enter, replacing the spell names with whatever spells you want to import. If you're not sure what spells are available, try the Guided approach mentioned immediately below.\n1. You should see a confirmation message in the chat window\n\nYour new spells are now ready for use!\n\n### Guided\nSimilar to monsters, **!shaped-spells** will display a list of all available spells in the database, pre-filled with all SRD spells. You need a character token selected, or you need to pass a character id like **!shaped-spells --character <character_id>**.\n\n## Tracking advantage using the script\n1. Configure your characters with the \"Normal\" roll option in the character sheet options (see later on for details of how to ensure that this is set automatically for characters imported with the script)\n1. Run **!shaped-config** from the chat window, click on 'Advantage Tracker' and then set 'Show Markers' to 'on' if\nit isn't already\n1. During play, when a character should have advantage or disadvantage, select their token and run **!shaped-at --advantage** from the chat window to give them advantage. Replace **--advantage** with **--disadvantage** or **--normal** for disadvantage/normal respectively.\n\n**IMPORTANT NOTE:** Advantage/disadvantage is a per-character setting, not per-token. If you have monster characters for which many tokens appear on the map at once (e.g. a horde of goblins), they will all get (dis)advantage at the same time - so don't forget to turn it off when you're finished with the token if it's only supposed to apply to one!\n\n### Auto reverting advantage/disadvantage\nWhen enabled, if the script detects a d20 roll with advantage or disadvantage, the character's roll option will be automatically reverted back to \"normal\".\n\n## Creating token actions for characters\nIt can be useful to create token action buttons for your characters to allow quick access to commonly used attacks, spells, actions, etc. For this you need to use the **!shaped-abilities** command. For example, **!shaped-abilities --attacks** will create a token action for each attack defined for your character. For full details of all the available options, please see below\n\n## Decrementing ammo\nThe script will automatically decrement ammo providing that the information is filled in correctly on the character sheet and the use ammo automatically option is turned on in the sheet options. See the character sheet documentation for more information.\n\n## Death saves, Hit Dice\nThe script will automatically decrement hit dice and apply regained HP when you roll them from the character sheet. You can turn this off in the [configuration](#configuration). When you roll a death save, it will add it to your death save successes/failures automatically, unless you have the roll 2 option on for your sheet rolls (since it won't know whether you succeeded or failed!)\n\n## Roll HP for monsters\nYou can configure one of your token bars to represent HP by default in the script [configuration](#configuration). If you do this, and enable the 'Roll HP on Drop' option, the script will automatically Roll HP for any character whose default token doesn't have a linked attribute for the specified bar. PCs and important individual NPCs should have their HP bar linked directly to the character sheet in their token setting, since they are individuals with a single HP value. Generic monsters ('mooks') should not have their HP bar linked to a character sheet attribute, however, since there can be several individuals all sharing a single character sheet. For these monsters, the script will automatically roll HP and apply it to a new token whenever you drag the character from the journal onto the table top. If you would prefer to have a static HP value for your mooks, you should disable this feature in the script configuration and set the HP value for the token manually before setting it as the default token for your character.\n\n## Process HD rolls\nIf enabled in the configuration (see below), the script will automatically apply hit dice rolled by clicking on the relevant HD line on the character sheet to the character's HP total. It will also decrement the number of HD remaining. It will issue a warning if no HD of the relevant size remain and won't add the amount to the HP total.\n\n## Decrement uses\nIf enabled in the configuration (see below), the script will automatically decrement the number of uses remaining for traits, actions, attacks, features, etc each time they are used. It will also issue a warning if something is used when no uses remain.\n\n## Short/Long rest\nThe script will apply the effects of a short/long rest if you run the command **!shaped-rest --type long** or **!shaped-rest --type short** with a character token selected. There are also buttons that link to this functionality on the character sheet itself. You can show these by entering \"edit mode\" on the sheet and ticking the checkbox on the Settings page for \"Show Rests\".\n\n# Full command list\n## !shaped-import-statblock\nImports details from a text statblock into a Roll20 character. The statblock must be inserted into the GM notes field of a token (_not_ a character!) and the token must be selected before running this command. The imported character will be configured with the default settings that you specify in the [default character settings configuration](#new-characters) . In addition the tokens you use will be configured according to the [default token settings configuration](#token-defaults) ready to be set as the default token for the character.\n\n### Options\n* **--overwrite** if the selected token already represents a character in the journal, the import will fail to avoid accidentally overwriting data, unless you supply this option to confirm that you wish to do so.\n* **--replace** if there is already a character in the journal with the same name as the one you are importing, the import will fail, whether or not the current token represents that character. This is to avoid creating loads of duplicates by mistake, which is almost never what you want to do. If you supply **--replace** the script will overwrite any character with the same name, unless there is more than one, in which case it will fail rather than risking overwriting the wrong one. Note that **--replace** implies **--overwrite**.\n\n### Selection\nYou must have at least one token selected. If you have more than one, it will attempt to import a statblock from each one in turn. When importing, each token will be set to represent the newly created character for it, and the script will also attempt to set the avatar for the character to be the token graphic<sup>[1](#avatar-note)</sup>.\n\n## !shaped-monsters\n* Alias !shaped-list-monsters\nDisplays a list of monsters in the currently loaded JSON database. The list is displayed in the chat window and includes buttons to filter the results on Type, CR and Size. The old \"Click to select a monster/spell\" query input (**!shaped-import-monster**) is available as a link at the top of the monsters/spells listings. Clicking a monster that is already imported won't remove it.\n\n## !shaped-monster\n* Alias !shaped-import-monster *\nImports details of named monsters from a database of custom monsters loaded as a separate script. The imported character will be configured with the default settings that you specify in the [default character settings configuration](#new-characters) . In addition the tokens you use will be configured according to the [default token settings configuration](#token-defaults) ready to be set as the default token for the character.\n\n### Options\n* **--<monster name>** (e.g. **--Lich**) specifies a monster to import. You may supply multiple monsters as separate options, or you may supply multiple in one option separated by commas (**--Ghoul, Zombie, Ghost**)\n* **--overwrite** if the selected token already represents a character in the journal, the import will fail to avoid accidentally overwriting data, unless you supply this option to confirm that you wish to do so.\n* **--replace** if there is already a character in the journal with the same name as the one you are importing, the import will fail, whether or not the current token represents that character. This is to avoid creating loads of duplicates by mistake, which is almost never what you want to do. If you supply **--replace** the script will overwrite any character with the same name, unless there is more than one, in which case it will fail rather than risking overwriting the wrong one. Note that **--replace** implies **--overwrite**.\n* **--as <new name>** if supplied, the new monster will be given the name specified instead of the default name defined in the database.\n\n### Selection\nYou may no or 1 tokens selected when running this command:\n\n* If you have no tokens selected, this command will just add the new characters to the journal.\n* If you have 1 token selected, and you are importing one monster, the script will attempt to use the token image as the avatar for your new character<sup>[1](#avatar-note)</sup>, and will also set the token to represent the newly created character\n* If you have 1 token selected and you are importing more than one monster, the script will only attempt to use the token image as the avatar for your new character<sup>[1](#avatar-note)</sup>.\n\n<a name=\"avatar-note\"/><sup>1</sup> Note that avatars will ony successfully be set for token images from your library, not marketplace or web content. This is due to security restrictions within the Roll20 platform. If you really want an image as a character avatar, please unpload it to your library and then create a token from it before doing your import.\n\n## !shaped-import-by-token\nThis basically does the same thing as [!shaped-import-monster](#shaped-import-monster), except that instead of passing it a list of monsters as parameters to the chat command, it infers the names of the monster to import from the names of the selected tokens. This is a quick way to configure and import a whole bunch of monsters all at once. Find the tokens you want for all your monster and drag them to the tabletop; name the tokens according to the monsters they represent, select them all, and run this command. It will find monsters by name from your custom JSON database, and configure each token to represent the new characters it creates.\n\n### Options\n* **--overwrite** as for [!shaped-import-monster](#shaped-import-monster)\n* **--replace** as for [!shaped-import-monster](#shaped-import-monster)\n\n### Selection\nYou must have at least one token selected for this command. As described above, it will use the name assigned to each token to lookup the monster it will represent from your JSON database.\n\n## !shaped-spell\n* Alias !shaped-import-spell *\nImports details of named spells from a database of customer spells loaded as a separate script. All spells will be added to the currently selected character. \n\n### Options\n* **--<spell name>** (e.g. **--Fireball**) specifies a spell to import. You may supply multiple spells as separate options, or you may supply multiple in one option separate by commas (**--Fireball, Lightning Bolt, Wish**)\n* **--overwrite** If this option is included, the script will ovewrite existing spells with the same name with the new spells requested, otherwise they will be skipped\n\n### Selection\nYou must have exactly one token that represents a character selected when running this command.\n\n## !shaped-spells\n* Alias !shaped-list-spells\nDisplays a list of spells in the currently loaded database that match the supplied criteria. Each spell will be a link to either import and delete the spell, depending on whether the selected/supplied character already has that spell in their spell list or not.\n\n### Options\n* **--character <characterID>** If there is no token selected, you must supply a character id for the character whose spells are to be edited.\n\n### Selection\nYou can have up to one token that represents a character selected when running this command.\n\n## !shaped-at\nGives the selected character advantage or disadvantage, or  neither.\n\n### Options\n* **--advantage** give the selected character advantage\n* **--disadvantage** give the selected character disadvantage\n* **--normal** clears (dis)advantage status for the selected character\n* **--revert** turns on auto revert advantage/disadvantage for the selected character\n* **--persist** turns off auto revert advantage/disadvantage for the selected character\n\n### Selection\nYou must select at least one token that represents a character. The specified setting will apply to the characters of all selected tokens.\n\n## !shaped-abilities\nCreates token actions for your character as shortcuts to a variety of rolls and other actions from the sheet.\n\n### Options\n* **--advantageTracker** - create 3 abilities, one for each Advantage Tracker option (Advantage, Disadvantage, Normal)\n* **--advantageTrackerShort** - create 3 abilities, one for each Advantage Tracker option, but with shorter names (Adv, Dis, Normal)\n* **--advantageTrackerShortest** - as **advantageTrackerShort**, but omit the \"normal\" option (for use with the auto-revert advantage option)\n* **--advantageTrackerQuery** - create an ability to set an Advantage Tracker option from a drop-down query\n* **--attacks** - create an ability for each attack present in the character sheet\n* **--attacksMacro** - create an ability to launch chat window attack buttons\n* **--traits** - create an ability for each trait present in the character sheet\n* **--traitsMacro** - create an ability to launch the chat window traits buttons\n* **--racialTraits** - create an ability for each racial trait present in the character sheet\n* **--racialTraitsMacro** - create an ability to launch the chat window racial traits buttons\n* **--classFeatures** - create an ability for each class feature present in the character sheet\n* **--classFeaturesMacro** - create an ability to launch the chat window class feature buttons\n* **--feats** - create an ability for each feat present in the character sheet\n* **--featsMacro** - create an ability to launch the chat window feat buttons\n* **--actions** - create an ability for each action present in the character sheet\n* **--actionsMacro** - create an ability to launch the chat window actions buttons\n* **--reactions** - create an ability for each reaction present in the character sheet\n* **--reactionsMacro** - create an ability to launch the chat window reactions buttons\n* **--legendaryActions** or **--legendaryA** - create an ability for each legendary action present in the character sheet\n* **--legendaryActionsMacro** - create an ability to launch chat window legendary actions buttons\n* **--lairActions** or **--lairA** - create an ability to launch chat window lair actions buttons\n* **--regionalEffects** or **--regionalE** - create an ability to launch chat window regional effects buttons\n* **--initiative** - create an ability to roll initiative\n* **--saves** or **--savingThrows** - create an ability to launch the chat window save buttons\n* **--savesQuery** or **--savingThrowsQuery** - create an ability to launch the save drop-down query\n* **--abilityChecks** or **--abilChecks** - create an ability to launch the chat window ability check buttons\n* **--abilityChecksQuery** or **--abilChecksQuery** - create an ability launch the ability check drop-down query\n* **--statblock** - create an ability to launch a chat window statblock display\n* **--spells** - create an ability to launch chat window spellbook display\n* **--rests** - create an ability to do a short or long rest (pops up a query to ask which)\n* **--DELETE** - delete all abilities on the token (including those not created by this script)\n\nIn addition, you can pass the names of spells like **--Fireball** to create token actions for each spell. Obviously the character in question must actually have this spell in its spellbook for this to work.\n\n### Selection\nYou must have at least one token that represents a character selected for this command to work. If you have multiple characters selected you cannot specify spells in the options since the different characters may have different spells.\n\n## !shaped-config\nDisplay configuration UI to change default behaviours. The significance of all the options is detailed [below](#configuration)\n\n## !shaped-apply-defaults\nApply the same defaults that are used when setting up tokens on import to whatever tokens are currently selected. Useful for mass-configuring manually created tokens. See [below](#config-token-settings) for more details on what these options are.\n\n### Selection\nYou must have at least one token that represents a character selected for this command to work. \n\n## !shaped-rest\nApplies the effects of a long or short rest, or a turn recharge\n\n### Options\n* **--type [long|short|turn] (required)** Specify what type of rest to perform. If this is 'turn', it will perform a 'turn recharge' - resetting uses for all actions/traits/etc that have X/turn usages. \n* **--character** Apply the rest to the supplied character id instead of the selected tokens\n\n### Selection\nYou must select at least one token that represents a character unless you supply the --character option. The selected character(s) will have the effects of the specified type of rest applied to them.\n\n## !shaped-update-character\nTriggers any pending character sheet upgrades for the selected characters. When a new version of the character sheet is released, there are often upgrade scripts that must run before previously created characters can be used with it. Normally these are run the first time you open each character sheet. For convenience, you can use this command to trigger these updates on batches of characters without having to open their sheets.\n\n### Options\n* **--all** Apply any pending character sheet upgrades for all characters in the current campaign. Note that this might take a *long* time in a large campaign - use with caution!\n\n## !shaped-expand-spells\nWhen you drag characters from the SRD/Compendium, they are imported with a spell list, but none of the spells have any content. This command will expand these \"stub spells\" using data from a custom spells database, if one is present.\n\n### Selection\nYou must select at least one token that represents a character. The selected character(s) will be checked for empty spells and these will be expanded from the custom JSON database.\n\n### Selection\nUnless you specify **--all** you must have at least one token that represents a character selected for this command to work.\n\n## !shaped-remove-spell\nRemoves spells from the selected character.\n\n### Options\n* **--all** If supplied, remove all spells from the selected character.\n* **--<spell name>** Remove spells by name from the selected character. You may supply multiple spells as separate options, or you may supply multiple in one option separate by commas (**--Fireball, Lightning Bolt, Wish**)\n\n### Selection\nYou must select exactly one token which represents a character.\n\n# Configuration\n## Advantage Tracker\n* **Output** Decides how Advantage Tracker will report changes (whisper the gm, public to all, or silent)\n* **Show Markers** If this is 'on', all tokens for a character will be marked with the specified markers if they have advantage or disadvantage. Designed for use with the [!shaped-at](#shaped-at) command\n* **Ignore NPCs** If this is 'on', Advantage Tracker will ignore NPCs\n* **Advantage Marker** Sets the status marker to be displayed when a character has Advantage if **Show Markers** is on\n* **Disadvantage Marker** Sets the status marker to be displayed when a character has Disadvantage if **Show Markers** is on\n\n## Token Defaults\nNote that all of the settings under Token Defaults are applied to tokens only when **!shaped-import-monster**, **!shaped-import-statblock** or **!shaped-apply-defaults** are run.\n\n* **Numbered Tokens** If this is 'on', new tokens will have %%NUMBERED%% appended to their name to work with Aaron's TokenNameNumbered script. Please search for this on the API forum for more details.\n* **Show Name Tag** If this is 'on', the token will show its name tag to anyone who has permission to see it\n* **Token Name Override** If this is not empty, new tokens will have their name tag set to this value. This is most useful in combination with Numbered Tokens, which allows you to have all your monsters labelled something like 'Monster 1', 'Monster 2', so your players can reference them but don't get any clues about what they are from the name.\n* **Show Name to Players** If this is 'on', and **Show Name Tag** is also 'on', players will be able to see the token's name.\n* **Light Radius** Default light radius emitted from token (Note that this value will be overriden by a value derived from a monster's senses attribute where available)\n* **Dim Radius** Start of dim light within the above-specified light radius (Note that this value will be overriden by a value derived from a monster's senses attribute where available)\n* **Other players see light** Whether light emitted from the token is visible only to the controlling player(s) or to all players\n* **Has Sight** If 'on' then controlling players will be able to see areas of maps with dynamic lighting enabled based on the position of this token\n* **Light angle** Emitted light will be cast in arc this many degrees wide.\n* **LOS angle** the token's vision will be limited to an arc this many degrees wide\n* **Light multiplier** The multiplier affects how far the token can see from existing light sources. This is a good way to simulate a character who has the ability to see further than normal in low light situations or has an alternate form of vision that might allow them to navigate in the dark. For example, someone who can see twice as far in low light would have a multiplier of two.\n\n## Token Defaults/Token Bar Options\n* **Bar X Attribute** Set this to the name of a sheet attribute (e.g. HP, AC, speed) to automatically set the specified token bar/bubble to the value of this attribute\n* **Bar X Link** If this is 'on' then the specified bar/bubble will be _linked_ to the configured attribute on the character sheet, i.e. changes to the bar/bubble will update the value on the character sheet. This is generally a good idea for everything except HP for generic tokens.\n* **Bar X Set Max** If this is 'on' then the specified bar will be given a maximum value (which will initially be the same as the main bar value) and will consequently display as a bar above the token as well as a value in the 'bubble'. Mainly useful for HP.\n* **Bar X Show Players** If this is 'on' then the specified bar/bubble will be shown to everyone, otherwise it will only be visible to the GM and controlling players\n* **Do not link NPC HP** If this is 'on' then the HP attribute will not be linked if the token represents an NPC, useful on HD-rolled characters.\n\n## Token Defaults/Token Aura Options\n* **Auras** Sets up default auras for new character tokens. If you specify a range, new characters will have an aura with the specified size, colour and shape\n* **Aura X Show Players** If this is 'on' then the specified aura will be shown to everyone, otherwise it will only be visible to the GM and controlling players\n\n## New Characters\nThe settings in this section will be applied to new characters when they are created, since the sheet has no way of storing default options\nfor new characters.\n\n* **Apply to all new chars?** If this is on, then the settings in this section will be applied to every new character, otherwise they will only be applied to characters created by the script using the various import commands, or when **!shaped-apply-defaults** is run. Please note that these defaults\nare applied at the moment of character creation, so some settings may not apply correctly - for example token actions which reference traits that have not yet been created. In this case, you should run **!shaped-apply-defaults** after your character is completely configured to complete the setup. You should also be aware that as things currently stand, this functionality does not work well for items dragged from the Compendium due to limitations in how the drag and drop functionality interacts with the sheet import systems.\n* **Sheet Output** Set whether output from the new character sheet should be public or whispered to the controlling player by default.\n* **Death Save Output** Same as Sheet Output, but specifically for death saves.\n* **Hit Dice Output** Same as Sheet Output, but specifically for Hit Dice.\n* **Roll Options** How are d20 rolls handled by default:\n    * **Normal**: Roll one die only.\n    * **Roll with Advantage**: Roll two dice, display the highest value.\n    * **Roll with Disadvantage**: Roll two dice, display the lowest value.\n    * **Roll 2**: Roll two dice, display both results.\n* **Initiative Settings** How are d20 rolls handled by default:\n    * **Initiative Output** Same as Sheet Output, but specifically for Initiative rolls\n    * **Init Roll** Similar as Roll Options, but only applies to Initiative rolls. There is no Roll 2 option in this case because initiative must have a single value to be sent to the turn tracker.\n    * **Init to Tracker** If 'on', automatically send all initiative rolls to the turn tracker.\n    * **Break Init Ties** If 'on', the value a character's initiative bonus will be divided by 100 and added to their initiative roll to break initiative ties (matching rolls mean the character with the highest bonus goes first)\n* **Show name on Roll Template** If 'on', the character's name will be shown on all their rolls in chat.\n* **Show Target AC** If 'on', all attacks and spells with a target will require a target to be clicked and will display the target's AC on the Roll output\n* **Show Target Name** If 'on', all attacks and spells with a target will require a target to be clicked and will display the target's character name on the Roll output\n* **Auto Roll Dmg Attacks** If 'on', all attacks with automatically roll and display damage.\n* **Auto Roll Dmg Saves** If 'on', all attacks with saves will automatically roll and display damage applied on save failure.\n* **Display Settings** This submenu configures the respective sheet fields to be visible by default on new characters.\n    * **Show Passive Skills** If 'on', will enable the display of passive skills in the skills section of the Core sheet page.\n    * **Show Weight** If 'on', will enable the display of weight information on the Core sheet page.\n    * **Show Emote** If 'on', will enable the Emote field which can be customized to automatically display the Emote on the attack template.\n    * **Show Freetext** If 'on', will enable the Freetext field on attack templates.\n    * **Show Freeform** If 'on', will enable the Freeform field on attack templates.\n    * **Show Dice Modifiers** If 'on', will enable Dice modifiers.\n    * **Show Crit Range** If 'on', will show Crit Range.\n    * **Extra on a Crit** If 'on', will enable the Extra on Crit field on attack templates which can be used to specify damage to be added automatically on crits.\n* **Automatic Higher Level Queries** If 'on', the script will query the player to cast spells at a higher level whenever possible.\n* **Auto Use Ammo** If 'on', ammo will automatically decrement when launching attacks that are configured with ammo.\n* **Revert advantage** If enabled, (dis)advantage will automatically be reverted back to rolling normally after the next d20 roll. Useful for the most common case where you get advantage on a single roll.\n* **Auto spell slots/points** If enabled, (dis)advantage will automatically be reverted back to rolling normally after the next d20 roll. Useful for the most common case where you get advantage on a single roll.\n* **Houserule Settings** See [!New Characters/Houserule Settings][#new-charactershouserule-settings].\n* **Measurement Systems** Choose between imperial or metric units:\n    * **Distance System** Select feet or meters.\n    * **Weight System** Select pounds or kilograms.\n* **Hide Settings** This submenu configures the default settings for the various \"hide\" options from the settings page of the character sheet. These settings are designed for use with a browser extension to help mask parts of the sheet output (see character sheet documentation for more details).\n* **Default token actions** Configures which token actions will be created automatically for the character. For details of what each of these actions are, please see the documentation for [!shaped-abilities](#roll-hp-for-monsters).\n\n## New Characters/Houserule Settings\n* **HP Recovered Long Rest** Configures how much HP should be restored on a long test.\n* **HD Recovered Long Rest** Configures how many Hit Die should be recovered on a long rest.\n* **Critical Damage** Configures the rule to apply for crits, normal rules (2x damage), max dice roll or none.\n* **Proficiency Dice** Enables the use of proficiency dice.\n* **Psionics** Enables the rules for Psionics.\n* **Custom Classes** Enables Custom classes.\n* **Expertise as advantage** Configures the default value of the \"expertise as advantage\" option on the character sheet.\n* **Medium Armor Max Dex** Sets the default value for medium armor max dex setting on the character sheet. This changes the maximum dexterity bonus allowed when wearing medium armor.\n* **Base DC** Configures the default value for Base DC from the character sheet.\n* **Honor** Enables the Honor system on the character sheet.\n* **Sanity** Enables the Sanity system on the character sheet.\n* **Multiple Inspiration** Allows multiple levels of inspiration on the character sheet.\n\n## New Characters/Houserule Settings/Saving Throws\n* **Half Proficiency Saves** Will tick the box for adding half proficiency to unproficient saving throws.\n* **Use Custom Saves** Will turn on the option to use custom saving throws for new characters.\n* **Use average of Highest Abils** If true, the custom saves configured below will use the average of the two highest abilities assigned to them rather than just taking the highest ability.\n* **Fortitude, Reflex, Will** These submenus configure the three custom saving throws for new characters. Under each one, you can assign which abilities are used to generate the respective saving throw.\n\n## Character Sheet Enhancements\n* **Roll HP On Drop** If 'on' the script will automatically Roll HP for any character whose default token doesn't have a linked attribute for the specified bar. See the [Roll HP for monsters](#roll-hp-for-monsters) section for more details.\n* **Process HD Automatically** If 'on' the script will automatically decrement your HD count when you roll hit dice and will also add the amount rolled to your HP total.\n* **Process Uses automatically** If 'on' the script will automatically decrement Use count for abilities with limited uses per resting period.\n* **Recharge uses on new turns** Automatically reset uses on \"per-turn\" abilities at the End of Turn.\n* **Show ammo recovery buttons** Enable buttons to automatically process recovered ammo.\n\n## Houserules & Variants\n* **Long Rest: No HP, full HD** If 'on', the long rest command will reset all HD to full, but will not restore any HP.\n",

This script is specifically designed to provide services and enhancements for the <a href=\"http://github.com/mlenser/roll20-character-sheets/tree/master/D%26D_5e_Reshaped\">5e Shaped Character Sheet</a> by Roll20 user Kryx. It <strong>will not work</strong> with any other character sheet such as the Roll20 5e OGL character sheet. If you report bugs/ask for help while trying to use the script with a different character sheet you will be ignored with extreme prejudice!</p>\n\n<p><strong>NOTE FOR 1-CLICK USERS</strong>: I recommend that you do not install this script via the 1-Click interface. Both the script and the sheet it supports are under very active development with frequent updates. If you install them from the Roll20 sheet list/1-click script page, they will update automatically without asking you when a new version is released. If something goes wrong, this can leave your campaign in a mess just before you&#39;re due to start a game session. Even when upgrades go smoothly, you may decide that you don&#39;t like changes that have been made and prefer the old version. Unless you install a specific version of the sheet and the script, you will have no control over this process, and downgrades after the fact are hard-to-impossible. </p>\n\n<h1>Key features</h1>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Automatically create characters from Monster Manual statblock text</li>\n<li>Import spells to characters from user-created databases of spells in JSON format</li>\n<li>Import monsters from user-created databases in JSON format</li>\n<li>Automatic population of NPC spells from JSON (if present) on import (both JSON and statblock)</li>\n<li>Auto HP rolling on drop for monster tokens</li>\n<li>Token setup with configurable defaults on monster import</li>\n<li>Auto ammo decrement</li>\n<li>Auto death save increment</li>\n<li>Auto HD reduction/HP increase on HD roll</li>\n<li>Advantage tracking commands - set a character to have (dis)advantage and mark which tokens this applies to</li>\n<li>Commands to create token actions for new characters</li>\n<li>Short/Long Rest handling</li>\n<li>Trait use count decrementing</li>\n<li>Automatic configuration of new characters</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1>Setup</h1>\n\n<h2>Prerequisites:</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>You, or the person who created your game, must be a <strong>Pro</strong> subscriber to Roll20 to use this script.</li>\n<li>You should be familiar with <a href=\"https://app.roll20.net/editor/tutorial\">how to use roll20</a>, have a basic understanding of how to <a href=\"https://wiki.roll20.net/Game_Management\">configure a game</a> on Roll20, including setting up <a href=\"https://wiki.roll20.net/Character_Sheets\">character sheets</a> and installing API scripts. If you&#39;ve only just started using Roll20 and haven&#39;t found your feet yet, setting this script up and using it is probably a bad place to start - it&#39;s an advanced tool, many of whose features presume a good working understanding of standard Roll20 capabilities. Play around with a simple campaign first, get used to making characters, working with tokens, and using the 5e Shaped Character Sheet manually; and then come back here for power-user goodness.</li>\n<li>You should have a recent version of the 5e Shaped Character Sheet. Due to the lack of versioning support with Roll20 character sheets, we <strong>strongly</strong> recommend that you install a specific version from <a href=\"https://github.com/mlenser/roll20-character-sheets/tree/master/5eShaped\">Kryx&#39;s Github</a>. Instructions for how to do this can be found on the thread on the <a href=\"https://app.roll20.net/forum/category/277980\">character sheets forum</a> - the threads change frequently but at the time of writing the latest one was <a href=\"https://app.roll20.net/forum/post/4450188/5e-shaped-version-8-plus\">here</a>. Although it is possible to install the character sheet from the list in game settings, we recommend that you don&#39;t do this for the reasons outlined at the beginning of this document.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Installation</h2>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Open the <a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/symposion/roll20-api-scripts/master/5eShapedCompanion/latest/5eShapedCompanion.js\">raw text of the script</a></li>\n<li>Copy all the text - <strong>Ctrl-A</strong> followed by <strong>Ctrl-C</strong> (or <strong>Cmd-A</strong>, <strong>Cmd-C</strong> on a Mac)</li>\n<li>Got to the API scripts page for your campaign</li>\n<li>Paste the text into a new script, and then give it a sensible name in the box at the top - e.g. &quot;5e Shaped Companion&quot;</li>\n<li>Hit save</li>\n<li>When the page refreshes, check the console box at the bottom of the page to make sure that there are no errors. If\neverything has worked you should see a line that looks a bit like: <code>&quot;ShapedScripts 1460893071206 INFO :   -=&gt; ShapedScripts v0.8.3 &lt;=-&quot;</code>. If you see a line that includes the text <code>ERROR</code> then Something Bad Has Happened and you should ask for help on the API scripts forum if you can&#39;t work the problem out for yourself from the error message (sometimes they are even helpful, I promise!)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>You are now set up and should be able to use the script as detailed below.</p>\n\n<h2>Updating</h2>\n\n<p>Sometimes a new version of the script comes out. If you have installed the script according to the instructions above, you will need to update it manually when this happens. The process is exactly the same as installing the original, except that when you paste the script into your campaign, you should <strong>replace</strong> the script text of the previous version rather than installing a new one. This is very important, because if you end up with two different versions of the script running at the same time, Bad Things Will Happen.</p>\n\n<h2>Optional Extras</h2>\n\n<p>Some of the script commands allow you to import spells or monsters from custom data files. This way of importing can be faster and more customisable than dragging from the Compendium, and it&#39;s also extensible: you can add extra data files to add more content. The script comes with all the SRD monsters and spells built-in. Creating additional custom data files is beyond the scope of this README at the moment, but you may find pre-made files floating around on the internet made by other people if you search for them. These should be script files that end in .js (<strong>not .json</strong>), and you install them in exactly the same way that you install the main script. If it worked, you should see some lines like this in your API log:<br/>\n<code><br/>\n&quot;ShapedScripts 1460893071585 INFO : Summary of adding entities to the lookup: {\\&quot;errors\\&quot;:0,\\&quot;monsters\\&quot;:{\\&quot;withErrors\\&quot;:0,\\&quot;skipped\\&quot;:0,\\&quot;deleted\\&quot;:0,\\&quot;patched\\&quot;:0,\\&quot;added\\&quot;:558}}&quot;<br/>\n</code></p>\n\n<h1>Usage</h1>\n\n<h2>Import a Monster from Monster Manual Statblock text</h2>\n\n<p>You first of all need a statblock from somewhere - generally speaking people get these from PDFs of adventures, or perhaps an OCRed copy of the Monster Manual. The statblock must conform to the layout conventions used by WotC for their 5e products or it will not work; fortunately most published material respects these conventions. Once you have statblock, follow these steps:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Create/find a token to represent your monster/character, and place it on the tabletop</li>\n<li>Open the token settings</li>\n<li>Paste your statblock into the GM notes for the token. Make sure that you haven&#39;t lost all of the linebreaks - the Roll20 text editor controls can be a bit funny about line-endings. Sometimes I have to paste the text into a text editor first, and then copy it out of there before I paste it into Roll20. It should look roughly like the original you copied it from, minus all the formatting. At this stage you might also want to check that it&#39;s not completely garbled, if e.g. it comes from an OCR scan of a print book. The script will fix a lot of mistakes, but it&#39;s still only a script - if the text is totally garbled you may need to fix some of the mistakes manually.</li>\n<li>When you&#39;re done, come out of the token editing and select the token.</li>\n<li>Type <strong>!shaped-import-statblock</strong> into the chat window and hit enter.</li>\n<li>You should see a message in the chat window, and end up with a new character in the journal. If you see an error\nmessage at this point you may need to fix up some problems with the text of the statblock</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Your new monster is now ready for use!</p>\n\n<h3>Notes on Statblock Text</h3>\n\n<p>The script does its best to fix up errors in the text and be tolerant of variances in layout, but there are some things<br/>\nthat it absolutely requires to be correct:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Character/monster name needs to be on its own line at the beginning</li>\n<li>Sections headers like &quot;Actions&quot; and &quot;Reactions&quot; need to be the last thing on a line to be recognised (and preferably on a line on their own, although the parser usually deals with this ok)</li>\n<li>Trait and action names need to be title case and end with a full stop, like in the MM.</li>\n<li>Don&#39;t paste in descriptions at the bottom of the statblock - just the statblock proper. This is because actions can be multiline and there is no way of telling where a final multiline action ends and a description begins (see e.g. Priest in the MM - don&#39;t paste the final description paragraph in)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Importing Monsters from the Script Database</h2>\n\n<h3>Manually</h3>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Find a token for your new monster and place it on the tabletop</li>\n<li>Select the token</li>\n<li>Type <strong>!shaped-import-monster --Lich</strong> into the chat window and hit enter, replacing &#39;Lich&#39; with the name of the monster you want to import. Obviously the monster name must match something in your database - which by default includes SRD monsters unless you&#39;ve added additional data files. If you&#39;re not sure what names are present in the database, or exactly what spelling is being used, try the Guided approach mentioned immediately below.</li>\n<li>You should see a message in the chat window, and end up with a new character in the journal.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Your new monster is now ready for use!</p>\n\n<h3>Guided</h3>\n\n<p>When you run <strong>!shaped-monsters</strong> it will output a scrollable list of all of the monsters in the chat window, along with filter buttons to allow you to narrow the list down by things like type, CR, school, class, etc. Clicking a monster on this list will import it into your library. This script comes with all the SRD monsters and spells built in.</p>\n\n<h2>Importing Spells from the Script Database</h2>\n\n<h3>Manually</h3>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Select a token that represents a character</li>\n<li>Type <strong>!shaped-import-spell --Fireball, Cure Wounds</strong> into the chat window and hit enter, replacing the spell names with whatever spells you want to import. If you&#39;re not sure what spells are available, try the Guided approach mentioned immediately below.</li>\n<li>You should see a confirmation message in the chat window</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Your new spells are now ready for use!</p>\n\n<h3>Guided</h3>\n\n<p>Similar to monsters, <strong>!shaped-spells</strong> will display a list of all available spells in the database, pre-filled with all SRD spells. You need a character token selected, or you need to pass a character id like <strong>!shaped-spells --character </strong>.</p>\n\n<h2>Tracking advantage using the script</h2>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Configure your characters with the &quot;Normal&quot; roll option in the character sheet options (see later on for details of how to ensure that this is set automatically for characters imported with the script)</li>\n<li>Run <strong>!shaped-config</strong> from the chat window, click on &#39;Advantage Tracker&#39; and then set &#39;Show Markers&#39; to &#39;on&#39; if\nit isn&#39;t already</li>\n<li>During play, when a character should have advantage or disadvantage, select their token and run <strong>!shaped-at --advantage</strong> from the chat window to give them advantage. Replace <strong>--advantage</strong> with <strong>--disadvantage</strong> or <strong>--normal</strong> for disadvantage/normal respectively.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>IMPORTANT NOTE:</strong> Advantage/disadvantage is a per-character setting, not per-token. If you have monster characters for which many tokens appear on the map at once (e.g. a horde of goblins), they will all get (dis)advantage at the same time - so don&#39;t forget to turn it off when you&#39;re finished with the token if it&#39;s only supposed to apply to one!</p>\n\n<h3>Auto reverting advantage/disadvantage</h3>\n\n<p>When enabled, if the script detects a d20 roll with advantage or disadvantage, the character&#39;s roll option will be automatically reverted back to &quot;normal&quot;.</p>\n\n<h2>Creating token actions for characters</h2>\n\n<p>It can be useful to create token action buttons for your characters to allow quick access to commonly used attacks, spells, actions, etc. For this you need to use the <strong>!shaped-abilities</strong> command. For example, <strong>!shaped-abilities --attacks</strong> will create a token action for each attack defined for your character. For full details of all the available options, please see below</p>\n\n<h2>Decrementing ammo</h2>\n\n<p>The script will automatically decrement ammo providing that the information is filled in correctly on the character sheet and the use ammo automatically option is turned on in the sheet options. See the character sheet documentation for more information.</p>\n\n<h2>Death saves, Hit Dice</h2>\n\n<p>The script will automatically decrement hit dice and apply regained HP when you roll them from the character sheet. You can turn this off in the <a href=\"#configuration\">configuration</a>. When you roll a death save, it will add it to your death save successes/failures automatically, unless you have the roll 2 option on for your sheet rolls (since it won&#39;t know whether you succeeded or failed!)</p>\n\n<h2>Roll HP for monsters</h2>\n\n<p>You can configure one of your token bars to represent HP by default in the script <a href=\"#configuration\">configuration</a>. If you do this, and enable the &#39;Roll HP on Drop&#39; option, the script will automatically Roll HP for any character whose default token doesn&#39;t have a linked attribute for the specified bar. PCs and important individual NPCs should have their HP bar linked directly to the character sheet in their token setting, since they are individuals with a single HP value. Generic monsters (&#39;mooks&#39;) should not have their HP bar linked to a character sheet attribute, however, since there can be several individuals all sharing a single character sheet. For these monsters, the script will automatically roll HP and apply it to a new token whenever you drag the character from the journal onto the table top. If you would prefer to have a static HP value for your mooks, you should disable this feature in the script configuration and set the HP value for the token manually before setting it as the default token for your character.</p>\n\n<h2>Process HD rolls</h2>\n\n<p>If enabled in the configuration (see below), the script will automatically apply hit dice rolled by clicking on the relevant HD line on the character sheet to the character&#39;s HP total. It will also decrement the number of HD remaining. It will issue a warning if no HD of the relevant size remain and won&#39;t add the amount to the HP total.</p>\n\n<h2>Decrement uses</h2>\n\n<p>If enabled in the configuration (see below), the script will automatically decrement the number of uses remaining for traits, actions, attacks, features, etc each time they are used. It will also issue a warning if something is used when no uses remain.</p>\n\n<h2>Short/Long rest</h2>\n\n<p>The script will apply the effects of a short/long rest if you run the command <strong>!shaped-rest --type long</strong> or <strong>!shaped-rest --type short</strong> with a character token selected. There are also buttons that link to this functionality on the character sheet itself. You can show these by entering &quot;edit mode&quot; on the sheet and ticking the checkbox on the Settings page for &quot;Show Rests&quot;.</p>\n\n<h1>Full command list</h1>\n\n<h2>!shaped-import-statblock</h2>\n\n<p>Imports details from a text statblock into a Roll20 character. The statblock must be inserted into the GM notes field of a token (<em>not</em> a character!) and the token must be selected before running this command. The imported character will be configured with the default settings that you specify in the <a href=\"#new-characters\">default character settings configuration</a> . In addition the tokens you use will be configured according to the <a href=\"#token-defaults\">default token settings configuration</a> ready to be set as the default token for the character.</p>\n\n<h3>Options</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>--overwrite</strong> if the selected token already represents a character in the journal, the import will fail to avoid accidentally overwriting data, unless you supply this option to confirm that you wish to do so.</li>\n<li><strong>--replace</strong> if there is already a character in the journal with the same name as the one you are importing, the import will fail, whether or not the current token represents that character. This is to avoid creating loads of duplicates by mistake, which is almost never what you want to do. If you supply <strong>--replace</strong> the script will overwrite any character with the same name, unless there is more than one, in which case it will fail rather than risking overwriting the wrong one. Note that <strong>--replace</strong> implies <strong>--overwrite</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Selection</h3>\n\n<p>You must have at least one token selected. If you have more than one, it will attempt to import a statblock from each one in turn. When importing, each token will be set to represent the newly created character for it, and the script will also attempt to set the avatar for the character to be the token graphic<a href=\"#avatar-note\">1</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>!shaped-monsters</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Alias !shaped-list-monsters\nDisplays a list of monsters in the currently loaded JSON database. The list is displayed in the chat window and includes buttons to filter the results on Type, CR and Size. The old &quot;Click to select a monster/spell&quot; query input (<strong>!shaped-import-monster</strong>) is available as a link at the top of the monsters/spells listings. Clicking a monster that is already imported won&#39;t remove it.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>!shaped-monster</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Alias !shaped-import-monster *\nImports details of named monsters from a database of custom monsters loaded as a separate script. The imported character will be configured with the default settings that you specify in the <a href=\"#new-characters\">default character settings configuration</a> . In addition the tokens you use will be configured according to the <a href=\"#token-defaults\">default token settings configuration</a> ready to be set as the default token for the character.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Options</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>--</strong> (e.g. <strong>--Lich</strong>) specifies a monster to import. You may supply multiple monsters as separate options, or you may supply multiple in one option separated by commas (<strong>--Ghoul, Zombie, Ghost</strong>)</li>\n<li><strong>--overwrite</strong> if the selected token already represents a character in the journal, the import will fail to avoid accidentally overwriting data, unless you supply this option to confirm that you wish to do so.</li>\n<li><strong>--replace</strong> if there is already a character in the journal with the same name as the one you are importing, the import will fail, whether or not the current token represents that character. This is to avoid creating loads of duplicates by mistake, which is almost never what you want to do. If you supply <strong>--replace</strong> the script will overwrite any character with the same name, unless there is more than one, in which case it will fail rather than risking overwriting the wrong one. Note that <strong>--replace</strong> implies <strong>--overwrite</strong>.</li>\n<li><strong>--as </strong> if supplied, the new monster will be given the name specified instead of the default name defined in the database.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Selection</h3>\n\n<p>You may no or 1 tokens selected when running this command:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>If you have no tokens selected, this command will just add the new characters to the journal.</li>\n<li>If you have 1 token selected, and you are importing one monster, the script will attempt to use the token image as the avatar for your new character<a href=\"#avatar-note\">1</a>, and will also set the token to represent the newly created character</li>\n<li>If you have 1 token selected and you are importing more than one monster, the script will only attempt to use the token image as the avatar for your new character<a href=\"#avatar-note\">1</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>1 Note that avatars will ony successfully be set for token images from your library, not marketplace or web content. This is due to security restrictions within the Roll20 platform. If you really want an image as a character avatar, please unpload it to your library and then create a token from it before doing your import.</p>\n\n<h2>!shaped-import-by-token</h2>\n\n<p>This basically does the same thing as <a href=\"#shaped-import-monster\">!shaped-import-monster</a>, except that instead of passing it a list of monsters as parameters to the chat command, it infers the names of the monster to import from the names of the selected tokens. This is a quick way to configure and import a whole bunch of monsters all at once. Find the tokens you want for all your monster and drag them to the tabletop; name the tokens according to the monsters they represent, select them all, and run this command. It will find monsters by name from your custom JSON database, and configure each token to represent the new characters it creates.</p>\n\n<h3>Options</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>--overwrite</strong> as for <a href=\"#shaped-import-monster\">!shaped-import-monster</a></li>\n<li><strong>--replace</strong> as for <a href=\"#shaped-import-monster\">!shaped-import-monster</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Selection</h3>\n\n<p>You must have at least one token selected for this command. As described above, it will use the name assigned to each token to lookup the monster it will represent from your JSON database.</p>\n\n<h2>!shaped-spell</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Alias !shaped-import-spell *\nImports details of named spells from a database of customer spells loaded as a separate script. All spells will be added to the currently selected character. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Options</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>--</strong> (e.g. <strong>--Fireball</strong>) specifies a spell to import. You may supply multiple spells as separate options, or you may supply multiple in one option separate by commas (<strong>--Fireball, Lightning Bolt, Wish</strong>)</li>\n<li><strong>--overwrite</strong> If this option is included, the script will ovewrite existing spells with the same name with the new spells requested, otherwise they will be skipped</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Selection</h3>\n\n<p>You must have exactly one token that represents a character selected when running this command.</p>\n\n<h2>!shaped-spells</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Alias !shaped-list-spells\nDisplays a list of spells in the currently loaded database that match the supplied criteria. Each spell will be a link to either import and delete the spell, depending on whether the selected/supplied character already has that spell in their spell list or not.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Options</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>--character </strong> If there is no token selected, you must supply a character id for the character whose spells are to be edited.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Selection</h3>\n\n<p>You can have up to one token that represents a character selected when running this command.</p>\n\n<h2>!shaped-at</h2>\n\n<p>Gives the selected character advantage or disadvantage, or  neither.</p>\n\n<h3>Options</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>--advantage</strong> give the selected character advantage</li>\n<li><strong>--disadvantage</strong> give the selected character disadvantage</li>\n<li><strong>--normal</strong> clears (dis)advantage status for the selected character</li>\n<li><strong>--revert</strong> turns on auto revert advantage/disadvantage for the selected character</li>\n<li><strong>--persist</strong> turns off auto revert advantage/disadvantage for the selected character</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Selection</h3>\n\n<p>You must select at least one token that represents a character.

Obviously the character in question must actually have this spell in its spellbook for this to work.</p>\n\n<h3>Selection</h3>\n\n<p>You must have at least one token that represents a character selected for this command to work. If you have multiple characters selected you cannot specify spells in the options since the different characters may have different spells.</p>\n\n<h2>!shaped-config</h2>\n\n<p>Display configuration UI to change default behaviours. The significance of all the options is detailed <a href=\"#configuration\">below</a></p>\n\n<h2>!shaped-apply-defaults</h2>\n\n<p>Apply the same defaults that are used when setting up tokens on import to whatever tokens are currently selected. Useful for mass-configuring manually created tokens. See <a href=\"#config-token-settings\">below</a> for more details on what these options are.</p>\n\n<h3>Selection</h3>\n\n<p>You must have at least one token that represents a character selected for this command to work. </p>\n\n<h2>!shaped-rest</h2>\n\n<p>Applies the effects of a long or short rest, or a turn recharge</p>\n\n<h3>Options</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>--type [long|short|turn] (required)</strong> Specify what type of rest to perform. If this is &#39;turn&#39;, it will perform a &#39;turn recharge&#39; - resetting uses for all actions/traits/etc that have X/turn usages. </li>\n<li><strong>--character</strong> Apply the rest to the supplied character id instead of the selected tokens</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Selection</h3>\n\n<p>You must select at least one token that represents a character unless you supply the --character option. The selected character(s) will have the effects of the specified type of rest applied to them.</p>\n\n<h2>!shaped-update-character</h2>\n\n<p>Triggers any pending character sheet upgrades for the selected characters. When a new version of the character sheet is released, there are often upgrade scripts that must run before previously created characters can be used with it. Normally these are run the first time you open each character sheet. For convenience, you can use this command to trigger these updates on batches of characters without having to open their sheets.</p>\n\n<h3>Options</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>--all</strong> Apply any pending character sheet upgrades for all characters in the current campaign. Note that this might take a <em>long</em> time in a large campaign - use with caution!</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>!shaped-expand-spells</h2>\n\n<p>When you drag characters from the SRD/Compendium, they are imported with a spell list, but none of the spells have any content. This command will expand these &quot;stub spells&quot; using data from a custom spells database, if one is present.</p>\n\n<h3>Selection</h3>\n\n<p>You must select at least one token that represents a character. The selected character(s) will be checked for empty spells and these will be expanded from the custom JSON database.</p>\n\n<h3>Selection</h3>\n\n<p>Unless you specify <strong>--all</strong> you must have at least one token that represents a character selected for this command to work.</p>\n\n<h2>!shaped-remove-spell</h2>\n\n<p>Removes spells from the selected character.</p>\n\n<h3>Options</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>--all</strong> If supplied, remove all spells from the selected character.</li>\n<li><strong>--</strong> Remove spells by name from the selected character. You may supply multiple spells as separate options, or you may supply multiple in one option separate by commas (<strong>--Fireball, Lightning Bolt, Wish</strong>)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Selection</h3>\n\n<p>You must select exactly one token which represents a character.</p>\n\n<h1>Configuration</h1>\n\n<h2>Advantage Tracker</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Output</strong> Decides how Advantage Tracker will report changes (whisper the gm, public to all, or silent)</li>\n<li><strong>Show Markers</strong> If this is &#39;on&#39;, all tokens for a character will be marked with the specified markers if they have advantage or disadvantage. Designed for use with the <a href=\"#shaped-at\">!shaped-at</a> command</li>\n<li><strong>Ignore NPCs</strong> If this is &#39;on&#39;, Advantage Tracker will ignore NPCs</li>\n<li><strong>Advantage Marker</strong> Sets the status marker to be displayed when a character has Advantage if <strong>Show Markers</strong> is on</li>\n<li><strong>Disadvantage Marker</strong> Sets the status marker to be displayed when a character has Disadvantage if <strong>Show Markers</strong> is on</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Token Defaults</h2>\n\n<p>Note that all of the settings under Token Defaults are applied to tokens only when <strong>!shaped-import-monster</strong>, <strong>!shaped-import-statblock</strong> or <strong>!shaped-apply-defaults</strong> are run.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Numbered Tokens</strong> If this is &#39;on&#39;, new tokens will have %%NUMBERED%% appended to their name to work with Aaron&#39;s TokenNameNumbered script. Please search for this on the API forum for more details.</li>\n<li><strong>Show Name Tag</strong> If this is &#39;on&#39;, the token will show its name tag to anyone who has permission to see it</li>\n<li><strong>Token Name Override</strong> If this is not empty, new tokens will have their name tag set to this value. This is most useful in combination with Numbered Tokens, which allows you to have all your monsters labelled something like &#39;Monster 1&#39;, &#39;Monster 2&#39;, so your players can reference them but don&#39;t get any clues about what they are from the name.</li>\n<li><strong>Show Name to Players</strong> If this is &#39;on&#39;, and <strong>Show Name Tag</strong> is also &#39;on&#39;, players will be able to see the token&#39;s name.</li>\n<li><strong>Light Radius</strong> Default light radius emitted from token (Note that this value will be overriden by a value derived from a monster&#39;s senses attribute where available)</li>\n<li><strong>Dim Radius</strong> Start of dim light within the above-specified light radius (Note that this value will be overriden by a value derived from a monster&#39;s senses attribute where available)</li>\n<li><strong>Other players see light</strong> Whether light emitted from the token is visible only to the controlling player(s) or to all players</li>\n<li><strong>Has Sight</strong> If &#39;on&#39; then controlling players will be able to see areas of maps with dynamic lighting enabled based on the position of this token</li>\n<li><strong>Light angle</strong> Emitted light will be cast in arc this many degrees wide.</li>\n<li><strong>LOS angle</strong> the token&#39;s vision will be limited to an arc this many degrees wide</li>\n<li><strong>Light multiplier</strong> The multiplier affects how far the token can see from existing light sources. This is a good way to simulate a character who has the ability to see further than normal in low light situations or has an alternate form of vision that might allow them to navigate in the dark. For example, someone who can see twice as far in low light would have a multiplier of two.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Token Defaults/Token Bar Options</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Bar X Attribute</strong> Set this to the name of a sheet attribute (e.g. HP, AC, speed) to automatically set the specified token bar/bubble to the value of this attribute</li>\n<li><strong>Bar X Link</strong> If this is &#39;on&#39; then the specified bar/bubble will be <em>linked</em> to the configured attribute on the character sheet, i.e. changes to the bar/bubble will update the value on the character sheet. This is generally a good idea for everything except HP for generic tokens.</li>\n<li><strong>Bar X Set Max</strong> If this is &#39;on&#39; then the specified bar will be given a maximum value (which will initially be the same as the main bar value) and will consequently display as a bar above the token as well as a value in the &#39;bubble&#39;. Mainly useful for HP.</li>\n<li><strong>Bar X Show Players</strong> If this is &#39;on&#39; then the specified bar/bubble will be shown to everyone, otherwise it will only be visible to the GM and controlling players</li>\n<li><strong>Do not link NPC HP</strong> If this is &#39;on&#39; then the HP attribute will not be linked if the token represents an NPC, useful on HD-rolled characters.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Token Defaults/Token Aura Options</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Auras</strong> Sets up default auras for new character tokens. If you specify a range, new characters will have an aura with the specified size, colour and shape</li>\n<li><strong>Aura X Show Players</strong> If this is &#39;on&#39; then the specified aura will be shown to everyone, otherwise it will only be visible to the GM and controlling players</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>New Characters</h2>\n\n<p>The settings in this section will be applied to new characters when they are created, since the sheet has no way of storing default options<br/>\nfor new characters.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Apply to all new chars?</strong> If this is on, then the settings in this section will be applied to every new character, otherwise they will only be applied to characters created by the script using the various import commands, or when <strong>!shaped-apply-defaults</strong> is run. Please note that these defaults\nare applied at the moment of character creation, so some settings may not apply correctly - for example token actions which reference traits that have not yet been created.

Create a macro bar button for the command `!cm -menu`\r2. Press the CashMaster button you just created.  It will display a menu in the chat log.\r3. Click on your character token\r4. Press the chat UI button titled Set Default Character.\r\r### GM Setup\r\r1. Create a macro bar button for the command `!cm -menu`\r2. Press the CashMaster button you just created.  It will display a menu in the chat log.\r3. Select the character tokens of ALL party members and companion NPCs.  Do not select pets or mounts unless the party considers them an equal member of the party (and thus should be a valid recipient for `-loot` and similar commands).  Such creatures must have full character sheets with currency fields.\r4. Press the chat UI button titled Set Party to Selected.\r5. For each shopkeeper, press the [Show Shop on Selected] button in the menu.  The shopkeeper must have a character sheet and the token must point to it.\r\r## Player Commands\r\r### Help Commands\r\r- `!cm` or `!cm -help` or `!cm -h` will show this help overview\r- `!cm -menu` or `!cm -tool` to bring up the user menu\r- `!cm -status` or `!cm -ss` to display your current coin purse contents\r\r### Accounting commands\r\rA character has a tracked account if it has discrete values for its saved coins.  PCs necessarily have tracked accounts while NPCs usually do not, instead having as much gold as the DM feels is necessary at that moment.\r- `!cm -transfer '[recipient character name]' [amount][currency]` or `!cm -t '[recipient character name]' [amount][currency]` to transfer coins to the recipient's tracked account.\r- `!cm -invoice '[recipient character name]' [amount][currency]` or `!cm -i '[recipient character name]' [amount][currency]` to request coins to the recipient's tracked account.\r- `!cm -giveNPC '[NPC Name, service rendered]' [amount][currency]` or `!cm -dropWithReason '[reason for dropping coins]' [amount][currency]` to move coins from the player's tracked account to an untracked account.\r\r### Shop Commands\r\r- `!cm -viewShop` or `!cm -vs` will display the shop data of the selected token to all players.  The GM is presented with both the player view and the edit view.\r- `!cm -viewItem '[item name]^[shopkeeper name]'` will display the details of a particular item from the specified shopkeeper.  This is used when the GM sets verbosity to low.\r- `!cm -buy '[item name]^[shopkeeper name]'` will attempt to purchase the named item from the named shopkeeper.  If you have sufficient funds, the funds will be removed and you will be presented with a purchase message.  If you are using the OGL character sheet, you will also find it transferred into your inventory.\r\r## GM Commands\r\rIn addition to the above commands, the GM has access to the following commands.\r\r### Help commands\r\r- `!cm` or `!cm -help` or `!cm -h` will show this help overview\r- `!cm -overview` or `!cm -o` to get an **overview** over the party's cash\r- `!cm -overview --usd` will also give you an overview and a rough conversion to USD (default value: 1 gp equals roughly 110 USD).\r\r### Accounting Commands\r\rThese operations directly add and remove gold from party inventories.\r- `!cm -add [amount][currency]` or `!cm -a [amount][currency]` to **add** an equal amount of money to each selected party member,\r- `!cm -loot [amount][currency]` or `!cm -l [amount][currency]` to **split up** a certain amount of coins between the party members, like a found treasure. Note that in this case, no conversion between the different coin types is made - if a party of 5 shares 4 pp, then 4 party members receive one pp each, and the last member won't get anything.\r- `!cm -sub [amount][currency]` or `!cm -pay [amount][currency]` or `!cm -p [amount][currency]` to let each selected party member **pay** a certain amount. The script will even try to take higher and lower coin types to get the full amount. E.g. to pay 1gp when the character has no gold, the script will use 1pp (and return 9gp), or it will take 2ep, 10sp or 100cp - or any other valid combination of coins - to pay the desired amount.\r\r### Admin Commands\r\rUse caution when using the below commands.\r- `!cm -merge` or `!cm -m` to **merge** coins to the densest denomination possible.\r- `!cm -share` or `!cm -s` to **reallocate and share** the money equally between selected party members, converting the amount into the best combination of gold, silver and copper (this should be used in smaller stores),\r- `!cm -best-share` or `!cm -bs` to **reallocate and share** the money equally between selected party members, converting the amount into the best combination of platinum, gold, electrum, silver and copper (this should only be used in larger stores that have a fair amount of cash),\r- `!cm -setParty` or `!cm -sp` to set the default party list.  These will be the default targets for party actions if you have nothing selected.\r- `!cm -revert` or `!cm -r` reverts a given transaction id.  This is an internal command used to revert transactions.\r\r### Shop Commands\r\rThese commands set up and manipulate shops.\r- `!cm -makeShop '[shop name]^[shop location]^[shop appearance]^[shopkeeper appearance]` creates a shop for the selected character token with the assigned attributes.  The token must point to a character sheet.  If you wish to have a single shop with multiple shopkeepers, use rollable tables and have them feed to the same character sheet for the shop.\r- `!cm -setShopVerbosity [high|low]` sets the amount of information that is printed out when displaying a shop.\r- `!cm -updateShop '[parameter name]^[parameter value]'` will update the named parameter to the new value.\r- `!cm -addItem '[item name]^[price]^[description]^[quantity]^[weight]^[properties]^[modifiers]'` creates a new item in the selected token's shop.\r- `!cm -updateItem '[item name]^[parameter name]^[parameter value]'` will look up the specified item name in the selected token's shop and update the named parameter to be the specified value.\r- `!cm -updateItem '[item name]^DELETE^YES'` will delete the specified item from the selected token's shop.\r- `!cm -updateItem '[item name]^DUPLICATE^YES'` will duplicate the specified item, adding a new item to the end of the shop's list of items named `'Copy of [item name]'`.\r\r## Tips\r\r1. `-noToken` and `-nt` will cause CashMaster to disregard what character is selected.\r2. You can use several coin values at once, e.g. `!cm -loot 50gp 150sp 2000cp` or `!cm -pay 2sp 5cp`.\r3. You can combine multiple subcommands into a single chat command with a double-semicolon `;;` between them.  For example, `!cm -add 5gp; -merge`\r4. You can select multiple subjects and targets using **Advanced Mode**.  For example, `!cm -transfer -S 'Billy Bob^Joe Bob' -T 'Sarah Bob^Sonya Bob' -C '10gp'`.  When using multiple subjects and targets, it will perform an operation for each subject-target pair.  In that case, it will perform four transactions of 10gp each.\r5. In **Advanced Mode**, you don't need to specify `-C '[amoung][currency]'` and can instead just use the standard `[amount][currency]`.  The ` -C ` currency tag allows you to specify the gp value at a particular point in the command in case you have strangley-named or inconveniently ID'd characters.\r6. CashMaster will parse **both character IDs and character names**.  You can even mix and match!  If Billy Bob's ID was `-L4ncF3ych3ZLtWaY3uY`, Instead of the example in **Tip 4**, you could use `!cm -transfer -S '-L4ncF3ych3ZLtWaY3uY^Joe Bob' -T 'Sarah Bob^Sonya Bob' -C '10gp'`.\r7. CashMaster is compatible with `@{selected|character_id}` and `@{target|character_id}` as they will simply be parsed down to IDs.  As an example, your players could use `!cm -t -T '@{target|character_id}' 1gp` to transfer a gold amongst themselves.\r\r## Examples\r\r1. `!cm -overview` will show a cash overview.\r2. `!cm -add 50gp` will add 50 gp to every selected character.\r3. `!cm -loot 50gp` will (more or less evenly) distribute 50 gp among the party members.\r4. `!cm -pay 10gp` will subtract 10gp from each selected character. It will try to exchange the other coin types (e.g. it will use 1pp if the player doesn't have 10gp).\r5. `!cm -share` will collect all the money and share it evenly on the members, using gp, sp and cp only (pp and ep will be converted). Can also be used for one character to 'exchange' money.\r6. `!cm -transfer 'Tazeka Liranov' 40gp` will transfer 40 gp from the selected token to the character sheet named Tazeka Liranov.\r7. `!cm -convert` - same as `!cm -share`, but will also use platinum and electrum.\r\r## Credits\r\rWith thanks to [Kryx](https://app.roll20.net/users/277007/kryx)/[mlenser](https://github.com/mlenser) and [Michael G.](https://app.roll20.net/users/1583758/michael-g)/[VoltCruelerz](https://github.com/VoltCruelerz) for their contributions.\r",

Note that in this case, no conversion between the different coin types is made - if a party of 5 shares 4 pp, then 4 party members receive one pp each, and the last member won&#39;t get anything.<br/>\n- <code>!cm -sub [amount][currency]</code> or <code>!cm -pay [amount][currency]</code> or <code>!cm -p [amount][currency]</code> to let each selected party member <strong>pay</strong> a certain amount. The script will even try to take higher and lower coin types to get the full amount. E.g. to pay 1gp when the character has no gold, the script will use 1pp (and return 9gp), or it will take 2ep, 10sp or 100cp - or any other valid combination of coins - to pay the desired amount.</p>\n\n<h3>Admin Commands</h3>\n\n<p>Use caution when using the below commands.<br/>\n- <code>!cm -merge</code> or <code>!cm -m</code> to <strong>merge</strong> coins to the densest denomination possible.<br/>\n- <code>!cm -share</code> or <code>!cm -s</code> to <strong>reallocate and share</strong> the money equally between selected party members, converting the amount into the best combination of gold, silver and copper (this should be used in smaller stores),<br/>\n- <code>!cm -best-share</code> or <code>!cm -bs</code> to <strong>reallocate and share</strong> the money equally between selected party members, converting the amount into the best combination of platinum, gold, electrum, silver and copper (this should only be used in larger stores that have a fair amount of cash),<br/>\n- <code>!cm -setParty</code> or <code>!cm -sp</code> to set the default party list.  These will be the default targets for party actions if you have nothing selected.<br/>\n- <code>!cm -revert</code> or <code>!cm -r</code> reverts a given transaction id.  This is an internal command used to revert transactions.</p>\n\n<h3>Shop Commands</h3>\n\n<p>These commands set up and manipulate shops.<br/>\n- <code>!cm -makeShop &#39;[shop name]^[shop location]^[shop appearance]^[shopkeeper appearance]</code> creates a shop for the selected character token with the assigned attributes.  The token must point to a character sheet.  If you wish to have a single shop with multiple shopkeepers, use rollable tables and have them feed to the same character sheet for the shop.<br/>\n- <code>!cm -setShopVerbosity [high|low]</code> sets the amount of information that is printed out when displaying a shop.<br/>\n- <code>!cm -updateShop &#39;[parameter name]^[parameter value]&#39;</code> will update the named parameter to the new value.<br/>\n- <code>!cm -addItem &#39;[item name]^[price]^[description]^[quantity]^[weight]^[properties]^[modifiers]&#39;</code> creates a new item in the selected token&#39;s shop.<br/>\n- <code>!cm -updateItem &#39;[item name]^[parameter name]^[parameter value]&#39;</code> will look up the specified item name in the selected token&#39;s shop and update the named parameter to be the specified value.<br/>\n- <code>!cm -updateItem &#39;[item name]^DELETE^YES&#39;</code> will delete the specified item from the selected token&#39;s shop.<br/>\n- <code>!cm -updateItem &#39;[item name]^DUPLICATE^YES&#39;</code> will duplicate the specified item, adding a new item to the end of the shop&#39;s list of items named <code>&#39;Copy of [item name]&#39;</code>.</p>\n\n<h2>Tips</h2>\n\n<ol>\n<li><code>-noToken</code> and <code>-nt</code> will cause CashMaster to disregard what character is selected.</li>\n<li>You can use several coin values at once, e.g. <code>!cm -loot 50gp 150sp 2000cp</code> or <code>!cm -pay 2sp 5cp</code>.</li>\n<li>You can combine multiple subcommands into a single chat command with a double-semicolon <code>;;</code> between them.  For example, <code>!cm -add 5gp; -merge</code></li>\n<li>You can select multiple subjects and targets using <strong>Advanced Mode</strong>.  For example, <code>!cm -transfer -S &#39;Billy Bob^Joe Bob&#39; -T &#39;Sarah Bob^Sonya Bob&#39; -C &#39;10gp&#39;</code>.  When using multiple subjects and targets, it will perform an operation for each subject-target pair.  In that case, it will perform four transactions of 10gp each.</li>\n<li>In <strong>Advanced Mode</strong>, you don&#39;t need to specify <code>-C &#39;[amoung][currency]&#39;</code> and can instead just use the standard <code>[amount][currency]</code>.  The <code>-C</code> currency tag allows you to specify the gp value at a particular point in the command in case you have strangley-named or inconveniently ID&#39;d characters.</li>\n<li>CashMaster will parse <strong>both character IDs and character names</strong>.  You can even mix and match!  If Billy Bob&#39;s ID was <code>-L4ncF3ych3ZLtWaY3uY</code>, Instead of the example in <strong>Tip 4</strong>, you could use <code>!cm -transfer -S &#39;-L4ncF3ych3ZLtWaY3uY^Joe Bob&#39; -T &#39;Sarah Bob^Sonya Bob&#39; -C &#39;10gp&#39;</code>.</li>\n<li>CashMaster is compatible with <code>@{selected|character_id}</code> and <code>@{target|character_id}</code> as they will simply be parsed down to IDs.  As an example, your players could use <code>!cm -t -T &#39;@{target|character_id}&#39; 1gp</code> to transfer a gold amongst themselves.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>Examples</h2>\n\n<ol>\n<li><code>!cm -overview</code> will show a cash overview.</li>\n<li><code>!cm -add 50gp</code> will add 50 gp to every selected character.</li>\n<li><code>!cm -loot 50gp</code> will (more or less evenly) distribute 50 gp among the party members.</li>\n<li><code>!cm -pay 10gp</code> will subtract 10gp from each selected character. It will try to exchange the other coin types (e.g. it will use 1pp if the player doesn&#39;t have 10gp).</li>\n<li><code>!cm -share</code> will collect all the money and share it evenly on the members, using gp, sp and cp only (pp and ep will be converted). Can also be used for one character to &#39;exchange&#39; money.</li>\n<li><code>!cm -transfer &#39;Tazeka Liranov&#39; 40gp</code> will transfer 40 gp from the selected token to the character sheet named Tazeka Liranov.</li>\n<li><code>!cm -convert</code> - same as <code>!cm -share</code>, but will also use platinum and electrum.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2>Credits</h2>\n\n<p>With thanks to <a href=\"https://app.roll20.net/users/277007/kryx\">Kryx</a>/<a href=\"https://github.com/mlenser\">mlenser</a> and <a href=\"https://app.roll20.net/users/1583758/michael-g\">Michael G.</a>/<a href=\"https://github.com/VoltCruelerz\">VoltCruelerz</a> for their contributions.</p>\n"

Create a macro button for `!mc -overview` called something like [Mass Combat].\r2. For each formation, start with a basic NPC creature’s character sheet and duplicate it.\r3. Drag a token of the duplicate onto the board and select it.\r4. Press your [Mass Combat] macro button.  A menu will appear in the log (see thread for details of each function).\r5. At the bottom of the menu, you’ll find a button named [Make Formation].  Press it and fill out the popups.\r6. Wait a few seconds as the script transforms the duplicate into a brand new character sheet for a formation.  You will be presented with status messages along the way.\r\r## Commands\r\r### Utility & Admin\r- `!mc -overview` Brings up the main menu, which has buttons for all the rest of these.\r- `!mc -makeFormation [NUMBER OF UNITS] [Levied|Manufactured|Mercenary] [Infantry|Cavalry|Archers|Scouts|Mages]` Converts a selected token and its character sheet into a formation.  Once a token has been turned into a formation, the red bar is health, the yellow bar is chaos points, and the blue bar is fatality points.  The bars are not permanently bound to underlying stats in the formation character sheet, so you can create duplicates without them sharing a health pool.  Once created, DO NOT RENAME IT without using the Rename command.  DO NOT MANUALLY ALTER BARS.  Use the damage/heal/recover/revert buttons.  The commands will account for fatality points and chaos points.  Manually altering them will not cause problems (unless you make a math error, in which case Long resting usually kills more of your troops).  Here is an example use of this command: `!mc -makeFormation 100 Levied Infantry`\r- `!mc -rename ^[NEW NAME]^` Renames the selected formation to the new name.  I use carets instead of quotes because quotes could reasonably show up in a character name.  For example `!mc -rename ^Bilbo Baggins^`\r- `!mc -history` Nearly every operation that changes the state of a formation creates an operation history entry.  This command allows you to peruse them and selectively revert them.\r- `!mc -battleRating` Displays the total Battle Rating of the selected formations.  If you also select hero units, they will also be displayed, but listed separately.\r- `!mc -upkeep` Displays the total upkeep of the selected formations, taking into account what creature type they are, how they are acquired, their CR, and how many there are.  It does not account for equipment costs.\r- `!mc -saveInitiative` Saves the current initiative order, in case you wish to zoom in on an encounter for a hero.  Warning: using this more than once will overwrite the previous save.\r- `!mc -loadInitiative` Loads the saved initiative order.\r\r### Statistics\rAll these operations require a selected formation token.\r- `!mc -resize [NUMBER OF UNITS]` Resizes the selected formation to have a new number of members, automatically adjusting hit points and action damage.  This is implicitly performed by the Long Rest and Make Formation commands.  Advanced calculations in these fields is not supported at this time.  Should the script encounter something it cannot parse, it will abort that action, inform the user, and continue on with any other actions the formation might have.\r- `!mc -setInt [NEW INT MODIFIER]` Sets the commander's intelligence modifier to the specified value, which is used for attack modifiers.\r- `!mc -ac` Displays the AC of the selected formation.  This button exists because a lot of people store AC in one of the other token bars, but Mass Combat occupies all three.\r- `!mc -speed` Displays the speed of the selected formation.  Similar to AC, this exists because a lot of people put speed in the other token bar.\r- `!mc -morale` Brings up the Morale menu with lots of configuration options for the selected formation.  The menu also includes a Leadership check roll.\r\r### Battle\rAll these operations require a selected formation token.  Those operations that add an icon can be altered manually, so you can undo it manually, but again, the history menu can revert any battle operation.  If you drop a formation to 50%, it'll gain an aura.  See compatibility with HealthColors below for details.\r#### Damage\r- `!mc -damage [Battle|Chaos|Fatality] [AMOUNT]` Deals damage of the assigned type to the formation.  Chaos and Fatality points are automatically calculated.  :)\r- `!mc -scaledDamage [Battle|Chaos|Fatality] [AMOUNT] [SCALE]` Deals scaled damage.  For instance, Fireball has a scale of 6 (2 + 40ft/10ft), so a Fireball dealing 24 damage would be `!mc -scaledDamage Battle 24 6`.\r#### Disorganize\r- `!mc -disorganize [NEW DISORGANIZATION SCALE|false]` Sets the disorganization level to the provided scale.  A value of `false` will turn off disorganization entirely.  This is stored as status icons.  If you want double-digit disorganization, you MUST go through the API because there's no way on the Roll20 UI to have the same icon twice.  I can cheat with the API though. ;)\r- `!mc -popDisorganize yes` Pops all current disorganization levels.  This has a confirmation parameter so that a user of the main menu does not accidentally press it (this feature came before history reversion).\r#### Recovery\r- `!mc -startRecover` Marks a token with an icon to symbolize recovery has started.\r- `!mc -recover` Removes the icon and converts chaos points into hit points.\r#### Restore\r- `!mc -heal [HEAL POINTS]` Attempts to heal a formation by the provided value.  It will be capped by the presence of fatality and chaos points.\r- `!mc -longrest yes` Performs the long rest operation on the selected formations.  This will first convert chaos points to hit points, and then Resize (see above) the formation to account for fatalities.  The user is then presented with the number of dead and survivors.  Like pop disorganization, this has a confirmation parameter for UI usability.\r#### Stance\r- `!mc -guard` Toggles the Guarding status icon for guarding formations.\r- `!mc -defend` Toggles the Defending status icon for defending formations.\r- `!mc -cooldown` Toggles the Cooldown status icon for mages that have already spent their burst damage.\r#### Route\r- `!mc -route [-1,0,1,2,3]` n=-1: not routed.  n=0: routed, but no failures.  n>0: routed with that number of failures.\r- `!mc -routeDamage` Deals a tick of route damage that formations experience at the beginning of their turn.\r\r## Operation\rMake a macro button for the overview command, and then just use the menu.  It's so much simpler. T.T\r\rSo, how do you use this?  After doing the setup steps above, you're basically set.  Set up a battlefield by dragging in formations.  Roll initiative for them, do combat, use initiative save/load as needed, and resolve combat.  Once you're done, perform the long rest operation on any formations you wish to persistently track.\r\r## Verison History\r\r- 0.7: First public release.  No longer available.\r- 0.9: Includes automated morale handling.\r- 1.0: Formations can now be created automatically. \r\r## Conflicts\rSo, it should come as no surprise that this script is pretty large and affects a lot.  Having said that, I've worked to make it as compatible as possible with other scripts.  \r\r### HealthColors\rI do not know of any scripts that it directly conflicts with, but Mass Combat does have interaction with [HealthColors](https://github.com/dxwarlock/Roll20/blob/master/Public/HeathColors).  I *love* HealthColors, but it does not detect when the API changes a token...so I made Mass Combat do it.  When you drop a formation to 50%, because being diminished is so important, it'll gain a yellow aura which will turn to red as you drop in health.  I've used the default colors that script utilizes, so this shouldn't cause any conflicts unless you special colors.  Having said that, you can dig into my source and look for `setTokenAura()`.  Essentially, it just ramps up the green parameter, so the RGB code goes from `FFFF00` to `FF0000` as you approach 0 hp.\r\r### Alters\r- `state.MassCombat` ...do I need to explain why I do this?\r- `token.status_*` I deliberately used a list for the status icons that did not conflict with Robin Kuiper's [StatusInfo](https://github.com/RobinKuiper/Roll20APIScripts) script. The ones I use are... Routed: \"status_chained-heart\", Guard: \"status_sentry-gun\", Defend: \"status_bolt-shield\", Cooldown: \"status_half-haze\", Disorganized: \"status_rolling-bomb\", Recovering: \"status_half-heart\", Dead: \"status_dead\".\r- `token.bar*` Again, shouldn't be a huge surprise that I alter the three bars of the tokens.\r- `char.[stat]` I alter a lot of stats when the make formation is performed.  Check out the `AttrEnum` object for full details.  \r- `char.traits` Ugh, so at the time of this writing, there's a sporadic bug with this, but it is NOT on my end.  My code still works fine and the data stored in the traits *is* there, but it doesn't display correctly when you look at the character sheet.  When you risk running into this, I print out a message to the GM explaining in greater detail.\r- `char.actions` Any attacks will be parsed to the script's best ability, as well as any description fields, which will look for `[[YOUR DICE ROLL HERE]]` and calculate it.  If you have some exotic ability references, that attack will abort and the script will prompt you to go do that one manually.",

Once you&#39;re done, perform the long rest operation on any formations you wish to persistently track.</p>\n\n<h2>Verison History</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>0.7: First public release.  No longer available.</li>\n<li>0.9: Includes automated morale handling.</li>\n<li>1.0: Formations can now be created automatically. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Conflicts</h2>\n\n<p>So, it should come as no surprise that this script is pretty large and affects a lot.  Having said that, I&#39;ve worked to make it as compatible as possible with other scripts.  </p>\n\n<h3>HealthColors</h3>\n\n<p>I do not know of any scripts that it directly conflicts with, but Mass Combat does have interaction with <a href=\"https://github.com/dxwarlock/Roll20/blob/master/Public/HeathColors\">HealthColors</a>.  I <em>love</em> HealthColors, but it does not detect when the API changes a token...so I made Mass Combat do it.  When you drop a formation to 50%, because being diminished is so important, it&#39;ll gain a yellow aura which will turn to red as you drop in health.  I&#39;ve used the default colors that script utilizes, so this shouldn&#39;t cause any conflicts unless you special colors.  Having said that, you can dig into my source and look for <code>setTokenAura()</code>.  Essentially, it just ramps up the green parameter, so the RGB code goes from <code>FFFF00</code> to <code>FF0000</code> as you approach 0 hp.</p>\n\n<h3>Alters</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>state.MassCombat</code> ...do I need to explain why I do this?</li>\n<li><code>token.status_*</code> I deliberately used a list for the status icons that did not conflict with Robin Kuiper&#39;s <a href=\"https://github.com/RobinKuiper/Roll20APIScripts\">StatusInfo</a> script. The ones I use are... Routed: &quot;status<em>chained-heart&quot;, Guard: &quot;status</em>sentry-gun&quot;, Defend: &quot;status<em>bolt-shield&quot;, Cooldown: &quot;status</em>half-haze&quot;, Disorganized: &quot;status<em>rolling-bomb&quot;, Recovering: &quot;status</em>half-heart&quot;, Dead: &quot;status_dead&quot;.</li>\n<li><code>token.bar*</code> Again, shouldn&#39;t be a huge surprise that I alter the three bars of the tokens.</li>\n<li><code>char.[stat]</code> I alter a lot of stats when the make formation is performed.  Check out the <code>AttrEnum</code> object for full details.<br/></li>\n<li><code>char.traits</code> Ugh, so at the time of this writing, there&#39;s a sporadic bug with this, but it is NOT on my end.  My code still works fine and the data stored in the traits <em>is</em> there, but it doesn&#39;t display correctly when you look at the character sheet.  When you risk running into this, I print out a message to the GM explaining in greater detail.</li>\n<li><code>char.actions</code> Any attacks will be parsed to the script&#39;s best ability, as well as any description fields, which will look for <code>[[YOUR DICE ROLL HERE]]</code> and calculate it.  If you have some exotic ability references, that attack will abort and the script will prompt you to go do that one manually.</li>\n</ul>\n"

        "description": "\r\r# SpellMaster\rSpellMaster is a high-performance total-replacement for the Spells page of the **D&D 5E by Roll20** character sheet with several additional key features that go beyond the default spells page.\r\rIt is an [Airbag](https://app.roll20.net/forum/post/7289686/script-airbag-api-crash-handler)-compatible script specifically built to be expandable and to allow DMs to add homebrew content.  The SRD spells are all provided.  To add additional spells, make use of the Export feature.\r\r## Features\r\r- **Instant Import:** Instantly add any spell (even homebrew!) in your master spell list to a character's spellbook.  Additionally, you can import a class's entire spell list to a spellbook during setup so your poor Druids and Clerics don't die of old age in Session 0.  SpellMaster also provides suggestions, should you mistype a spell name.\r- **Class List Perusing:** Peruse all spells your character could know and easily swap them in and out.\r- **Filtering:** filter by VSM, Ritual, Concentration, Preparedness, Slots Remaining, and the inverse of all of these.  General string search and cast time filtering are also provided.\r- **Preparation Lists:** Create and configure independent lists of prepared spells for every scenario.\r- **Permanent Preparation:** Supports spells that are both conditionally prepared and always prepared, even those that can be used a finite number of times a day without expending slots.\r- **Performance:** SpellMaster is built to support games with hundreds of spells in play without slowing to a crawl.  My own game features 730, compared to the SRD's 319 or Stock's 456.\r- **Compendium Interface:** SpellMaster has a semi-automated system to allow you to import spells from your purchased compendium expansions and then export them into your private spell list.\r- **Homebrew Support:** Utilizing the same export system, you can add or update house spells.\r- **Macro Support:** Macros of the commands SpellMaster uses are valid.\r- **Casting & Slot Tracking:** This would hardly be a spell manager if you couldn't cast or track slots.\r- **Sorcery Point Tracking:** This tool handles sorcery point conversions.\r- **Magic Item Tacking:** SpellMaster allows creation of magic items that run on charges.\r\r## Setup\r1. Click Install below, as you would with any other script.\r2. If you have a lot of homebrewed or purchased compendium spells, skip down to the **Export** section of this and return here when you're done.\r3. Create a Handout with a unique name of your choice, such as \"Tazeka's Spells.\"  Give Tazeka's player control of the handout.  This handout will become Tazeka's spellbook, fully replacing all need for the 5e OGL character sheet's spell page.\r4. Run the following command to bring up the base SpellMaster menu: `!SpellMaster`\r5. In the chat menu, a simple gui will appear.  Press **[Create Spellbook]**.  You will be prompted for some basic information.  Fill out the prompts.\r6. Navigate to the handout and see that it has been populated!  Tazeka now has a dedicated spellbook!\r7. I recommend going to Tazeka's main character sheet's **Bio & Info** tab and creating a link to her spells handout.  In our example above, you would simply write `[Tazeka's Spells]`.  When you save, Roll20 will convert that into a link to the handout.  \r\rThe player will have full edit power over the spellbook.\r\r## Operation\rThe below section will go through the various features of SpellMaster in the same order they appear within the sheet.\r\r### Filtering\rAt the top of the sheet, you'll see the ability to filter by the presence (or absence!) of VSM components, as well as Cast Time, Concentration, Preparation, Ritual, Slots Remaining, Cast Time, and a general string search that can be used for other fields such as the description or Range.\r\r### Tools\r- **Long Rest:** This will refill all slots and sorcery points to their maximum, and trigger a recharge on any magical items, as tracked by SpellMaster.  SpellMaster uses an independent resource tracking system (due to the **Cache**), so this will not alter the base character sheet in any way.\r- **Level-Up:** This flushes the cache and reconstructs the maximum slot counts for spell levels.  Press this once upon level-up.  It supports full-casters, half-casters, third-casters, pact magic, and any combination of the above.  Note that this does not update your sheet's *current* slots, only the maximums.  Some GMs allow level-up immediately in combat, so I wished to allow that behavior.\r- **Refresh Cache:** SpellMaster's performance is *heavily* reliant on an internal data cache that keeps things running smoothly.  Simply put, the sheer volume of data SpellMaster manages would easily fill up a third of your game's maximum memory size and bog your game to a crawl if it was not carefully managed.  As it is, SpellMaster is designed to run more powerfully and efficiently than the stock OGL sheet.  In practice, what this means for you is that the first time you perform an action with a spellbook per game, the user will experience a mild hitch, with much better performance thereafter.  This button is for cases where you *must* flush the cache, such as when changing your spellcasting modifier (which is the reason Level Up automatically flushes your sheet).\r\r### Sorcery Points\rBy default, this is 0/0, but you can click the links to update them.  Then, once you have done so, you may use the **[Compose Slot]** link here to generate spell slots, as well as the **[Decompose]** buttons down below to convert spell slots back into sorcery points.\r\r### Prepared Tracking\rThe preparedness tracker will make its best effort to track spells, even across several classes.  It also does not restrict the user from over-preparation, and should be treated as a guideline.  It does not treat permanently prepared spells as counting against its computed maximum prepared spells.\r\r###  Items\rNew in SpellMaster 2.000, magic items allow you to track spell enchantments on magic items.  Generally, items function similarly to spells (detailed below), but they have a few additional features of their own.  The below section references the above image.\r- **[X] Staff of Power - [3] / [20] - [-]**\r    - **[X]**: The staff is currently attuned.  Click to toggle.\r    - **Staff of Power**: Click to rename.\r    - **[3] / [20]**: The item has 3 of 20 maximum charges.  Click a number to change it.  Upon activation, charges are automatically consumed.\r    -  **[-]**: Will collapse the item's details.\r- **Requires Attunement**: This allows you to control whether the item requires attunement or not.  If it requires attunement and is not attuned, its enchantments deactivate.\r- **Appearance**: Describe the appearance of the item.  This is a flavor field and has no mechanical effect.\r- **Effect**: Describe the effect of the item.  This is a flavor field and has no mechanical effect.\r- **Enchantments**: The list of enchantments.  By pressing **[+]** on an enchantment, you can expand it.\r    - **[3] Fireball [-]**: The enchantment is a fireball enchantment that will consume 3 charges upon activation.  Click the charge count to change it or click the enchantment name to cast it.  If an enchantment requires more charges than are presently available, its activation link will be disabled.  When you attempt to activate an item, if you can upcast the enchantment, you will be prompted to specify at what tier you wish to employ the item.\r    - **DC**: You can specify the DC or the ability score to use for casting a particular effect.\r    - **Upcast Cost**: Set the cost for upcasting the enchantment, presuming it can be upcast.  Click **Upcast Cost** to set if it can be upcast and the number itself to set the upcast cost per tier/level.\r- **Add Spell Enchantment**: Currently, only spell enchantments are supported.  A future release will enable custom enchantments that trigger effects of your design.  Until then, you can always create a new homebrew spell with the effect and enchant with that.\r- **Recharge Rate**: Set the recharge rate.  This supports both constants and die rolls using Roll20's roll engine.\r\r### Spells\rSpells appear within their level in alphabetical order.\r\r- **Level 1 Spells - [4] / [4] - [...]**: The initial line denotes the spell level and current spell slots.  Click on a number to change it.  Currents *can* be higher than maximums, though Long Rest will reset them back to the maximum.  Pressing `[...]` will display all knowable spells for your character given your classes and spell lists at the specified level in the chat where you can add or remove them at your liesure.\r- **[_] Azdregath's Opulent Ooze (R) - [-]**: The line with the spell's name on it has several features.\r    - **[_]**: Clicking this empty checkbox will fill it with an X to mark it as prepared.  Cantrips are always checked.\r    - **Azdregath's Opulent Ooze**: Clicking this will cast the spell.  See the casting details below.\r    - **(R)**: This marks the spell as a ritual.  Concentration spells will be marked with `(C)`.\r    - **[-]**: As elsewhere, this will compress or expand the spell details.\r- **[0] / [0]**: Should you have a spell you can cast a finite number of times a day without expending a spell slot, you can edit its individual \"slots\" here.  If these are non-zero, they will appear in the name-line of the spell, allowing you to view them at a glance.\r- **Manually Prepared**: If you have a spell that is always prepared, you can lock it as automatically prepared here.  This can be useful for classes with permanently-known spells or spells with lists of auto-prepared spells.  A permanently-prepared spell is marked with a **[O]** in its preparedness checkbox.\r- **Description**: The next several lines simply provide the details of the spell.  The description is automatically parsed for indicators of saving throws, spell attacks, and upcasting.  When a spell is cast, this is then accounted for.\r- **Ability**: Clicking on this will allow you to set the spellcasting ability of the spell.  If you select **Manual DC**, you will be presented with the ability to set that value manually as well.  Note that any spell attack will have a modifier 8 lower than the DC you specify.\r- **Notes**: This field allows you to insert custom notes for a given spell.  These notes will be displayed at cast-time.  You can add custom rolls into this field if you wish by including something such as `[[1d4+1]]`, which will be evaluated by the roll engine.\r- **Classes**: This is the list of classes that learn this spell.\r- **Delete**: As with all deletes, this requires a confirmation dialog.\r\rAt the bottom of any spell level, you will find a **[+]**.  Press it to bring up a dialog to add a new spell.  You **MUST** type the name correctly.  If you cannot remember the precise name or spelling, it is often easier to use the **[...]** chat menu.\r\r### Preparation Lists\rThese function as radio buttons.  Press the checkbox for the spell preparation list of your choice and then make any preparation selections.  These will automatically be saved. should you create a new preparation list and switch to it.  Permanently Prepared spells are global to the spellbook and do not change between preparation lists.  The parenthetical number is the number of spells in that list.  \r\rPress **[-]** to delete a list and **[+]** to create a new one.\r\r## Casting with SpellMaster\rWhenever you cast a spell or activate an item enchantment, you'll be presented with the opportunity to upcast the spell if you can.  If you cannot, or after your selection, the spell card will be printed to the chat log.  If a spell has individual slots, they will be consumed before your main slots.  The spell will be parsed to detect spell attacks or saving throws.  If there is no attack roll, the fields that host those values will default to 0.\r\r## Spell Export\rIf you homebrew or purchased compendium content, the steps below dictate how to replace the stock SRD spell list with your own.\r1. Create a **NEW** character sheet (the process will overwrite the character sheet).  I'll call it **House Spells**.  Navigate to its spell page.  This is the last time you'll use this page for your PCs in your game, thanks to SpellMaster.\r2. Open your compendium.  Filter by spells.\r3. Begin the (admittedly slow) process of dragging and dropping all those spells into House Spells, ignoring those in the SRD.  For each, you **MUST** manually fill out the Class field with the list of classes (ie `Druid, Warlock, Wizard`) because Roll20 has a bug that prevents it.\r4. Add any additional homebrew spells you allow at your table.  If you have any special alterations to existing spells, include those as well.  Just **MAKE SURE** the name is unchanged, and the exporter will take your new version and ignore the stock version.  If you wish to **Rename** or **Ban** a spell at your table, name the spell either `RENAME|Old Name|New Name` or `DELETE|Banned Name`.\r5. Once you're done, bring up the spellmaster menu with `!SpellMaster` and press **[Export Homebrew]**.  This will bring up a dialog option in which you type in the name of the character sheet.  Begin export.\r6. The export process will begin in the background.  It is *processor-intensive* on the server, and SpellMaster is forced to throttle itself, lest the API watchdog kill it.  As a result, the process, depending on the number of spells, can take seconds to minutes to complete.  You will be notified when it completes through a chat message.\r7. Open **House Spells** and navigate to the **Bio & Info** tab.  There, you'll find yourself face-to-face with an enormous javascript file containing all your spells in the format SpellMaster reads.  Copy all code there.\r8. Navigate to your campaign's API page and create a custom script.  Call it something like `SpellList.js` and paste in the copied code.\r9. Save the script.  This will trigger an API reboot.  When the API comes back up, it will prioritize your list over its internal SRD list.\r\rYour players will thereafter be able to add your custom spells to their character sheets.\r\r## Performance\rSpellMaster was largely born out of a dissatisfaction with the performance of existing tools and character sheets.\r- The master spell list is stored in an API script and the exports are handled through a character sheet, which have a significantly higher data cap than the game state.  SpellMaster's data, were it to be stored in state would eat about a third of it.\r- Expensive operations are cached, so only part of the page is regenerated at a time.  Without a cache, certain operations take >300ms.  With it, they take <5ms.\r- Spellbooks are in handouts rather than the main character sheet because loading a character sheet can take a painfully long time at higher levels, and SpellMaster is designed to be performant at *all* levels of play.  For your convenience, however, the top of the spellbook contains a link to the main character sheet.\r\r## Known Bugs\r### Roll Clone\r- **Summary**: When whispering to the rolls to both the GM and the player privately, the whispered rolls do not match.\r- **Workaround**: Configure player rolls to not be whispered to the GM or give the GM ownership of all player characters.  I do not mean merely give **All Players** control.  I mean give the DM themselves control.\r- **Resolution**: The Aaron and GiG have recently informed me of a means of dodging this bug, which is relatively simple\r- **Roadmap**: I would like to get to this within the next few versions.\r\r## Zero-Zero\r- **Summary**: The HTML template that is currently used does not support no attack roll value, which is why they currently default to zero.\r- **Workaround**: Ignore it.  It hurts nothing except your eyes.\r- **Resolution**: I'll need to build my own roll template or find another mechanism.  For instance, if I were to integrate with PowerCards, that would resolve the issue, though I would need assistance from that script's developer(s).\r- **Roadmap**: No imminent plans to resolve this, though I would like to eventually.\r\r## Releases\r- 1.0: Initial Release\r    - 1.1: Add whisper inheritance, add manual DCs\r    - 1.2: Advanced Caching and Homebrew Export\r    - 1.3: Export now handles all levels automatically for you.\r        - 1.3.1: Fixed a minor spell preparation bug for Druids and Clerics.\r    - 1.4 Add cast time filtering, add rename and delate to export.\r    - 1.5: Add knowables printing, improve spell slot count algorithm.\r    - 1.6: Add sorcery points.\r    - 1.7: Fix sorcery point migration bug.\r    - 1.8: Add auto-population solution for paladins.\r    - 1.9: Add range searching to general string search.\r- 2.000: Magic Items, one-click install, new version number system\r    - 2.001: Enabled auto-rolling of rolled item charges.\r    - 2.002: Damerau-Levenshtein distance suggestions for mistyped spells, item sorting\r\r## Future Work\r### Usability\r- **Bug Fixes**: Obviously, bug hunting is always desirable.\r- **Regex Searching**: It's handy!\r- **Shaped Sheet Compatibility**: Support for this is a looooooooong way off, but hey, it'd be nice!\r### Features\r- **Custom Item Enchantments**: I plan for this, which will likely be the next release.\r- **Improved NPC Support**: Currently, SpellMaster only supports PC characters.  I *definitely* want this feature, so it is a priority.\r- **Short Rest Recharge**: Certainly, I can't *fully* support everything that might happen on a short rest, but I can at least add something.  Most notably, Pact Magic and custom spell enchantments recharge would be nice.\r- **Ritual Casting**: I would like to enable ritual casting as a dropdown option for such spells.  Currently, the user would have to manually give themselves a slot back.  Not a *huge* pain, but still annoying.\r- **Slotless Casting**: I would like to see some sort of damage ticking system that rerolls the description sheet, though I've yet to come up with a good solution.  I welcome suggestions.\r\r## Contact\r\rFeel free to contact me at any of the following for comments, suggestions, or bug reports.\r- [github](https://github.com/VoltCruelerz)\r- [Roll20](https://app.roll20.net/users/1583758/gm-michael)\r- [Forums](https://app.roll20.net/forum/post/8109696/script-spellmaster-2-dot-0-5e-ogl-magic-handler-thread-3)",

      "mdowninstructions": "<h1>SpellMaster</h1>\n\n<p>SpellMaster is a high-performance total-replacement for the Spells page of the <strong>D&amp;D 5E by Roll20</strong> character sheet with several additional key features that go beyond the default spells page.</p>\n\n<p>It is an <a href=\"https://app.roll20.net/forum/post/7289686/script-airbag-api-crash-handler\">Airbag</a>-compatible script specifically built to be expandable and to allow DMs to add homebrew content.  The SRD spells are all provided.  To add additional spells, make use of the Export feature.</p>\n\n<h2>Features</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Instant Import:</strong> Instantly add any spell (even homebrew!) in your master spell list to a character&#39;s spellbook.  Additionally, you can import a class&#39;s entire spell list to a spellbook during setup so your poor Druids and Clerics don&#39;t die of old age in Session 0.  SpellMaster also provides suggestions, should you mistype a spell name.</li>\n<li><strong>Class List Perusing:</strong> Peruse all spells your character could know and easily swap them in and out.</li>\n<li><strong>Filtering:</strong> filter by VSM, Ritual, Concentration, Preparedness, Slots Remaining, and the inverse of all of these.  General string search and cast time filtering are also provided.</li>\n<li><strong>Preparation Lists:</strong> Create and configure independent lists of prepared spells for every scenario.</li>\n<li><strong>Permanent Preparation:</strong> Supports spells that are both conditionally prepared and always prepared, even those that can be used a finite number of times a day without expending slots.</li>\n<li><strong>Performance:</strong> SpellMaster is built to support games with hundreds of spells in play without slowing to a crawl.  My own game features 730, compared to the SRD&#39;s 319 or Stock&#39;s 456.</li>\n<li><strong>Compendium Interface:</strong> SpellMaster has a semi-automated system to allow you to import spells from your purchased compendium expansions and then export them into your private spell list.</li>\n<li><strong>Homebrew Support:</strong> Utilizing the same export system, you can add or update house spells.</li>\n<li><strong>Macro Support:</strong> Macros of the commands SpellMaster uses are valid.</li>\n<li><strong>Casting &amp; Slot Tracking:</strong> This would hardly be a spell manager if you couldn&#39;t cast or track slots.</li>\n<li><strong>Sorcery Point Tracking:</strong> This tool handles sorcery point conversions.</li>\n<li><strong>Magic Item Tacking:</strong> SpellMaster allows creation of magic items that run on charges.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Setup</h2>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Click Install below, as you would with any other script.</li>\n<li>If you have a lot of homebrewed or purchased compendium spells, skip down to the <strong>Export</strong> section of this and return here when you&#39;re done.</li>\n<li>Create a Handout with a unique name of your choice, such as &quot;Tazeka&#39;s Spells.&quot;  Give Tazeka&#39;s player control of the handout.  This handout will become Tazeka&#39;s spellbook, fully replacing all need for the 5e OGL character sheet&#39;s spell page.</li>\n<li>Run the following command to bring up the base SpellMaster menu: <code>!SpellMaster</code></li>\n<li>In the chat menu, a simple gui will appear.  Press <strong>[Create Spellbook]</strong>.  You will be prompted for some basic information.  Fill out the prompts.</li>\n<li>Navigate to the handout and see that it has been populated!  Tazeka now has a dedicated spellbook!</li>\n<li>I recommend going to Tazeka&#39;s main character sheet&#39;s <strong>Bio &amp; Info</strong> tab and creating a link to her spells handout.  In our example above, you would simply write <code>[Tazeka&#39;s Spells]</code>.  When you save, Roll20 will convert that into a link to the handout.<br/></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The player will have full edit power over the spellbook.</p>\n\n<h2>Operation</h2>\n\n<p>The below section will go through the various features of SpellMaster in the same order they appear within the sheet.</p>\n\n<h3>Filtering</h3>\n\n<p>At the top of the sheet, you&#39;ll see the ability to filter by the presence (or absence!) of VSM components, as well as Cast Time, Concentration, Preparation, Ritual, Slots Remaining, Cast Time, and a general string search that can be used for other fields such as the description or Range.</p>\n\n<h3>Tools</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Long Rest:</strong> This will refill all slots and sorcery points to their maximum, and trigger a recharge on any magical items, as tracked by SpellMaster.  SpellMaster uses an independent resource tracking system (due to the <strong>Cache</strong>), so this will not alter the base character sheet in any way.</li>\n<li><strong>Level-Up:</strong> This flushes the cache and reconstructs the maximum slot counts for spell levels.  Press this once upon level-up.  It supports full-casters, half-casters, third-casters, pact magic, and any combination of the above.  Note that this does not update your sheet&#39;s <em>current</em> slots, only the maximums.  Some GMs allow level-up immediately in combat, so I wished to allow that behavior.</li>\n<li><strong>Refresh Cache:</strong> SpellMaster&#39;s performance is <em>heavily</em> reliant on an internal data cache that keeps things running smoothly.  Simply put, the sheer volume of data SpellMaster manages would easily fill up a third of your game&#39;s maximum memory size and bog your game to a crawl if it was not carefully managed.  As it is, SpellMaster is designed to run more powerfully and efficiently than the stock OGL sheet.  In practice, what this means for you is that the first time you perform an action with a spellbook per game, the user will experience a mild hitch, with much better performance thereafter.  This button is for cases where you <em>must</em> flush the cache, such as when changing your spellcasting modifier (which is the reason Level Up automatically flushes your sheet).</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Sorcery Points</h3>\n\n<p>By default, this is 0/0, but you can click the links to update them.  Then, once you have done so, you may use the <strong>[Compose Slot]</strong> link here to generate spell slots, as well as the <strong>[Decompose]</strong> buttons down below to convert spell slots back into sorcery points.</p>\n\n<h3>Prepared Tracking</h3>\n\n<p>The preparedness tracker will make its best effort to track spells, even across several classes.  It also does not restrict the user from over-preparation, and should be treated as a guideline.  It does not treat permanently prepared spells as counting against its computed maximum prepared spells.</p>\n\n<h3>Items</h3>\n\n<p>New in SpellMaster 2.000, magic items allow you to track spell enchantments on magic items.  Generally, items function similarly to spells (detailed below), but they have a few additional features of their own.  The below section references the above image.<br/>\n- <strong>[X] Staff of Power - [3] / [20] - [-]</strong><br/>\n    - <strong>[X]</strong>: The staff is currently attuned.  Click to toggle.<br/>\n    - <strong>Staff of Power</strong>: Click to rename.<br/>\n    - <strong>[3] / [20]</strong>: The item has 3 of 20 maximum charges.  Click a number to change it.  Upon activation, charges are automatically consumed.<br/>\n    -  <strong>[-]</strong>: Will collapse the item&#39;s details.<br/>\n- <strong>Requires Attunement</strong>: This allows you to control whether the item requires attunement or not.  If it requires attunement and is not attuned, its enchantments deactivate.<br/>\n- <strong>Appearance</strong>: Describe the appearance of the item.  This is a flavor field and has no mechanical effect.<br/>\n- <strong>Effect</strong>: Describe the effect of the item.  This is a flavor field and has no mechanical effect.<br/>\n- <strong>Enchantments</strong>: The list of enchantments.  By pressing <strong>[+]</strong> on an enchantment, you can expand it.<br/>\n    - <strong>[3] Fireball [-]</strong>: The enchantment is a fireball enchantment that will consume 3 charges upon activation.  Click the charge count to change it or click the enchantment name to cast it.  If an enchantment requires more charges than are presently available, its activation link will be disabled.  When you attempt to activate an item, if you can upcast the enchantment, you will be prompted to specify at what tier you wish to employ the item.<br/>\n    - <strong>DC</strong>: You can specify the DC or the ability score to use for casting a particular effect.<br/>\n    - <strong>Upcast Cost</strong>: Set the cost for upcasting the enchantment, presuming it can be upcast.  Click <strong>Upcast Cost</strong> to set if it can be upcast and the number itself to set the upcast cost per tier/level.<br/>\n- <strong>Add Spell Enchantment</strong>: Currently, only spell enchantments are supported.  A future release will enable custom enchantments that trigger effects of your design.  Until then, you can always create a new homebrew spell with the effect and enchant with that.<br/>\n- <strong>Recharge Rate</strong>: Set the recharge rate.  This supports both constants and die rolls using Roll20&#39;s roll engine.</p>\n\n<h3>Spells</h3>\n\n<p>Spells appear within their level in alphabetical order.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Level 1 Spells - [4] / [4] - [...]</strong>: The initial line denotes the spell level and current spell slots.  Click on a number to change it.  Currents <em>can</em> be higher than maximums, though Long Rest will reset them back to the maximum.  Pressing <code>[...]</code> will display all knowable spells for your character given your classes and spell lists at the specified level in the chat where you can add or remove them at your liesure.</li>\n<li><strong>[_] Azdregath&#39;s Opulent Ooze (R) - [-]</strong>: The line with the spell&#39;s name on it has several features.\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>[_]</strong>: Clicking this empty checkbox will fill it with an X to mark it as prepared.  Cantrips are always checked.</li>\n<li><strong>Azdregath&#39;s Opulent Ooze</strong>: Clicking this will cast the spell.  See the casting details below.</li>\n<li><strong>(R)</strong>: This marks the spell as a ritual.  Concentration spells will be marked with <code>(C)</code>.</li>\n<li><strong>[-]</strong>: As elsewhere, this will compress or expand the spell details.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><strong>[0] / [0]</strong>: Should you have a spell you can cast a finite number of times a day without expending a spell slot, you can edit its individual &quot;slots&quot; here.  If these are non-zero, they will appear in the name-line of the spell, allowing you to view them at a glance.</li>\n<li><strong>Manually Prepared</strong>: If you have a spell that is always prepared, you can lock it as automatically prepared here.  This can be useful for classes with permanently-known spells or spells with lists of auto-prepared spells.  A permanently-prepared spell is marked with a <strong>[O]</strong> in its preparedness checkbox.</li>\n<li><strong>Description</strong>: The next several lines simply provide the details of the spell.  The description is automatically parsed for indicators of saving throws, spell attacks, and upcasting.  When a spell is cast, this is then accounted for.</li>\n<li><strong>Ability</strong>: Clicking on this will allow you to set the spellcasting ability of the spell.  If you select <strong>Manual DC</strong>, you will be presented with the ability to set that value manually as well.  Note that any spell attack will have a modifier 8 lower than the DC you specify.</li>\n<li><strong>Notes</strong>: This field allows you to insert custom notes for a given spell.  These notes will be displayed at cast-time.  You can add custom rolls into this field if you wish by including something such as <code>[[1d4+1]]</code>, which will be evaluated by the roll engine.</li>\n<li><strong>Classes</strong>: This is the list of classes that learn this spell.</li>\n<li><strong>Delete</strong>: As with all deletes, this requires a confirmation dialog.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>At the bottom of any spell level, you will find a <strong>[+]</strong>.  Press it to bring up a dialog to add a new spell.  You <strong>MUST</strong> type the name correctly.  If you cannot remember the precise name or spelling, it is often easier to use the <strong>[...]</strong> chat menu.</p>\n\n<h3>Preparation Lists</h3>\n\n<p>These function as radio buttons.  Press the checkbox for the spell preparation list of your choice and then make any preparation selections.  These will automatically be saved. should you create a new preparation list and switch to it.  Permanently Prepared spells are global to the spellbook and do not change between preparation lists.  The parenthetical number is the number of spells in that list.  </p>\n\n<p>Press <strong>[-]</strong> to delete a list and <strong>[+]</strong> to create a new one.</p>\n\n<h2>Casting with SpellMaster</h2>\n\n<p>Whenever you cast a spell or activate an item enchantment, you&#39;ll be presented with the opportunity to upcast the spell if you can.  If you cannot, or after your selection, the spell card will be printed to the chat log.  If a spell has individual slots, they will be consumed before your main slots.  The spell will be parsed to detect spell attacks or saving throws.  If there is no attack roll, the fields that host those values will default to 0.</p>\n\n<h2>Spell Export</h2>\n\n<p>If you homebrew or purchased compendium content, the steps below dictate how to replace the stock SRD spell list with your own.<br/>\n1. Create a <strong>NEW</strong> character sheet (the process will overwrite the character sheet).  I&#39;ll call it <strong>House Spells</strong>.  Navigate to its spell page.  This is the last time you&#39;ll use this page for your PCs in your game, thanks to SpellMaster.<br/>\n2. Open your compendium.  Filter by spells.<br/>\n3. Begin the (admittedly slow) process of dragging and dropping all those spells into House Spells, ignoring those in the SRD.  For each, you <strong>MUST</strong> manually fill out the Class field with the list of classes (ie <code>Druid, Warlock, Wizard</code>) because Roll20 has a bug that prevents it.<br/>\n4. Add any additional homebrew spells you allow at your table.  If you have any special alterations to existing spells, include those as well.  Just <strong>MAKE SURE</strong> the name is unchanged, and the exporter will take your new version and ignore the stock version.  If you wish to <strong>Rename</strong> or <strong>Ban</strong> a spell at your table, name the spell either <code>RENAME|Old Name|New Name</code> or <code>DELETE|Banned Name</code>.<br/>\n5. Once you&#39;re done, bring up the spellmaster menu with <code>!SpellMaster</code> and press <strong>[Export Homebrew]</strong>.  This will bring up a dialog option in which you type in the name of the character sheet.  Begin export.<br/>\n6. The export process will begin in the background.  It is <em>processor-intensive</em> on the server, and SpellMaster is forced to throttle itself, lest the API watchdog kill it.  As a result, the process, depending on the number of spells, can take seconds to minutes to complete.  You will be notified when it completes through a chat message.<br/>\n7. Open <strong>House Spells</strong> and navigate to the <strong>Bio &amp; Info</strong> tab.  There, you&#39;ll find yourself face-to-face with an enormous javascript file containing all your spells in the format SpellMaster reads.  Copy all code there.<br/>\n8. Navigate to your campaign&#39;s API page and create a custom script.  Call it something like <code>SpellList.js</code> and paste in the copied code.<br/>\n9. Save the script.  This will trigger an API reboot.  When the API comes back up, it will prioritize your list over its internal SRD list.</p>\n\n<p>Your players will thereafter be able to add your custom spells to their character sheets.</p>\n\n<h2>Performance</h2>\n\n<p>SpellMaster was largely born out of a dissatisfaction with the performance of existing tools and character sheets.<br/>\n- The master spell list is stored in an API script and the exports are handled through a character sheet, which have a significantly higher data cap than the game state.  SpellMaster&#39;s data, were it to be stored in state would eat about a third of it.<br/>\n- Expensive operations are cached, so only part of the page is regenerated at a time.  Without a cache, certain operations take &gt;300ms.  With it, they take &lt;5ms.<br/>\n- Spellbooks are in handouts rather than the main character sheet because loading a character sheet can take a painfully long time at higher levels, and SpellMaster is designed to be performant at <em>all</em> levels of play.  For your convenience, however, the top of the spellbook contains a link to the main character sheet.</p>\n\n<h2>Known Bugs</h2>\n\n<h3>Roll Clone</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Summary</strong>: When whispering to the rolls to both the GM and the player privately, the whispered rolls do not match.</li>\n<li><strong>Workaround</strong>: Configure player rolls to not be whispered to the GM or give the GM ownership of all player characters.  I do not mean merely give <strong>All Players</strong> control.  I mean give the DM themselves control.</li>\n<li><strong>Resolution</strong>: The Aaron and GiG have recently informed me of a means of dodging this bug, which is relatively simple</li>\n<li><strong>Roadmap</strong>: I would like to get to this within the next few versions.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Zero-Zero</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Summary</strong>: The HTML template that is currently used does not support no attack roll value, which is why they currently default to zero.</li>\n<li><strong>Workaround</strong>: Ignore it.  It hurts nothing except your eyes.</li>\n<li><strong>Resolution</strong>: I&#39;ll need to build my own roll template or find another mechanism.  For instance, if I were to integrate with PowerCards, that would resolve the issue, though I would need assistance from that script&#39;s developer(s).</li>\n<li><strong>Roadmap</strong>: No imminent plans to resolve this, though I would like to eventually.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Releases</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>1.0: Initial Release\n\n<ul>\n<li>1.1: Add whisper inheritance, add manual DCs</li>\n<li>1.2: Advanced Caching and Homebrew Export</li>\n<li>1.3: Export now handles all levels automatically for you.\n\n<ul>\n<li>1.3.1: Fixed a minor spell preparation bug for Druids and Clerics.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>1.4 Add cast time filtering, add rename and delate to export.</li>\n<li>1.5: Add knowables printing, improve spell slot count algorithm.</li>\n<li>1.6: Add sorcery points.</li>\n<li>1.7: Fix sorcery point migration bug.</li>\n<li>1.8: Add auto-population solution for paladins.</li>\n<li>1.9: Add range searching to general string search.</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li>2.000: Magic Items, one-click install, new version number system\n\n<ul>\n<li>2.001: Enabled auto-rolling of rolled item charges.</li>\n<li>2.002: Damerau-Levenshtein distance suggestions for mistyped spells, item sorting</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Future Work</h2>\n\n<h3>Usability</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Bug Fixes</strong>: Obviously, bug hunting is always desirable.</li>\n<li><strong>Regex Searching</strong>: It&#39;s handy!</li>\n<li><strong>Shaped Sheet Compatibility</strong>: Support for this is a looooooooong way off, but hey, it&#39;d be nice!\n### Features</li>\n<li><strong>Custom Item Enchantments</strong>: I plan for this, which will likely be the next release.</li>\n<li><strong>Improved NPC Support</strong>: Currently, SpellMaster only supports PC characters.  I <em>definitely</em> want this feature, so it is a priority.</li>\n<li><strong>Short Rest Recharge</strong>: Certainly, I can&#39;t <em>fully</em> support everything that might happen on a short rest, but I can at least add something.  Most notably, Pact Magic and custom spell enchantments recharge would be nice.</li>\n<li><strong>Ritual Casting</strong>: I would like to enable ritual casting as a dropdown option for such spells.  Currently, the user would have to manually give themselves a slot back.  Not a <em>huge</em> pain, but still annoying.</li>\n<li><strong>Slotless Casting</strong>: I would like to see some sort of damage ticking system that rerolls the description sheet, though I&#39;ve yet to come up with a good solution.  I welcome suggestions.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Contact</h2>\n\n<p>Feel free to contact me at any of the following for comments, suggestions, or bug reports.<br/>\n- <a href=\"https://github.com/VoltCruelerz\">github</a><br/>\n- <a href=\"https://app.roll20.net/users/1583758/gm-michael\">Roll20</a><br/>\n- <a href=\"https://app.roll20.net/forum/post/8109696/script-spellmaster-2-dot-0-5e-ogl-magic-handler-thread-3\">Forums</a></p>\n"

The vast majority of its features will not work with any other sheet and no such support is planned/considered.\r\n\r\n**Note**: If you are using this script with Roll20's 1-Click install, be aware that sometimes inconsistent updates between the sheet and the script can leave things not working, and you have little to no control over this (and neither have I, really). If you want a more reliable experience, install both sheet and script manually instead of using Roll20's automatic systems.\r\n\r\nContents\r\n--------\r\n<!-- run `doctoc README.md --maxlevel 4` to update this file -->\r\n<!-- START doctoc generated TOC please keep comment here to allow auto update -->\r\n<!-- DON'T EDIT THIS SECTION, INSTEAD RE-RUN doctoc TO UPDATE -->\r\n\r\n\r\n- [Command Overview](#command-overview)\r\n- [Installation](#installation)\r\n  - [Prerequisites](#prerequisites)\r\n  - [Installation](#installation-1)\r\n    - [EPCompendium](#epcompendium)\r\n    - [Updating](#updating)\r\n- [Command Descriptions](#command-descriptions)\r\n  - [Battle Manager](#battle-manager)\r\n    - [Usage](#usage)\r\n    - [Recommended Macros](#recommended-macros)\r\n  - [Character Cleaner](#character-cleaner)\r\n    - [Usage](#usage-1)\r\n    - [Recommended Macros](#recommended-macros-1)\r\n  - [Character Tools](#character-tools)\r\n    - [Usage](#usage-2)\r\n    - [Recommended Macros](#recommended-macros-2)\r\n  - [GM Tools](#gm-tools)\r\n    - [Usage](#usage-3)\r\n    - [Recommended Macros](#recommended-macros-3)\r\n  - [Group Rolls](#group-rolls)\r\n    - [Usage](#usage-4)\r\n    - [Recommended Macros](#recommended-macros-4)\r\n  - [Special Rolls](#special-rolls)\r\n    - [Usage](#usage-5)\r\n    - [Recommended Macros](#recommended-macros-5)\r\n  - [Token Setup](#token-setup)\r\n    - [Usage](#usage-6)\r\n    - [Recommended Macros](#recommended-macros-6)\r\n  - [Compendium](#compendium)\r\n    - [Usage](#usage-7)\r\n    - [Recommended Macros](#recommended-macros-7)\r\n\r\n<!-- END doctoc generated TOC please keep comment here to allow auto update -->\r\n\r\nCommand Overview\r\n----------------\r\nIn this section we give a quick overview over all available commands. They describe in detail in later individual sections.\r\n\r\n**Note**: You can always run `!<cmd> --help` in Roll20 chat to get a quick description of the options available for each `<cmd>`.\r\n\r\n\r\n- **Battle Manager** (`!epbattleman`) manages Action Turns and Action Phases based on character speed, as well as rerolls iniative for everyone at the beginning of a new turn automatically.\r\n- **Character Cleaner** (`!epclean`) resets or empties certain sections on the character sheet, in order to automate backups, or egocasts.\r\n- **Character Tools** (`!epchar`) applies damage, wounds, stress, and traumas automatically, taking armour into account as appropriate.\r\n- **GM Tools** (`!epgmtools`) can be configured to show skills for a whole party, in order to easily roll Perception checks, for example.\r\n- **Group Rolls** (`!epgroup-roll`) can be used to roll EP specific common rolls like *Fray/2*, *Initiative*, or simply an arbitrary skill check, for a group of selected tokens.\r\n- **Special Rolls** (`!epspecialroll`) is a script that manages rolling common EP rolls, without involving a character sheet. Convenient for the improvising GM, who doesn't have an NPC ready to import, but still needs it to shoot something, for example.\r\n- **Token Setup** (`!eptoken`) generate token abilities for skills, *Fray/2*, or *Initiative*.\r\n- **Compendium** manages data from the [Eclipse Phase Compendium](https://github.com/Bathtor/EPCompendium):\r\n\t- *Data* (`!epcompendium-data`) manages search, lookups, and display of compendium data to the chat.\r\n\t- *Export* (`!epcompendium-export`) can export custom morphs in a Compendium-compatible format, so they can be imported into other character sheets.\r\n\t- *Import* (`!epcompendium-import`) manages character, trait, morph, and item imports.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\n### Prerequisites\r\n\r\n- You must be a **Pro** subscriber of Roll20 to use API scripts in general, and this script in particular.\r\n- You'll need a recent version of the [Eclipse Phase 1E sheet](https://github.com/Bathtor/EPSheet). I'll try to be clear in the documentation, which script version works with which sheet version, but generally the latest release of each should always work together. And if you picked the wrong versions, it should complain and not break anything.\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\n- Open the **raw** text of the latest release of the script. At the time of writing that is [v1.0.2](https://github.com/Bathtor/EPSheet/releases/download/script-v1.0.2/ep-script.js).\r\n- Copy *all* the text -- **Ctrl+A** followed by **Ctrl+C** (**Cmd+A**, **Cmd+C** on a Mac)\r\n- Go to the API Script page for your Roll20 campaign\r\n- Paste the text into a new script, or override an older version if updating. Don't forget to give it a sensible name, e.g. `epscript.js`!\r\n- Save the script\r\n- Leave the Roll20 API Script page open, and open up your campaign view in a different tab/window. That should cause your sandbox to spin up. If no errors are reported, you should be good to go.\r\n\r\n#### EPCompendium\r\nIf you would like access to the EPCompendium-related features, you must also install the data script for the compendium. Follow the same procedure as above for the latest release of the EPCompendium, [v6.0.0](https://github.com/Bathtor/EPCompendium/releases/tag/v6.0.0) at the time of writing. Each Compendium release also contains a number of macros prepared to use with the script that you can just c&p into your campaign.\r\n\r\n**Note** that there's a load time dependency between the compendium script and the companion script, so make sure that the compendium script's tab is to the right of the companion script's.\r\n\r\n#### Updating\r\nIf you need to update one of the script installed above, simply follow the same instructions as for a normal installation. Do make sure, that you always override old script versions, and never have two versions running in parallel!\r\n\r\nCommand Descriptions\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\n### Battle Manager\r\n**Command**: `!epbattleman`\r\n\r\nThe EP Battle Manager deals with EP's hierarchical combat timing structure based on *Action Turns* and *Action Phases* in Roll20's Turn Order mechanism. Each *Action Turn* begins by rolling iniative. Then every participant may take perform actions in the iniative order in the first *Action Phase*. For participants with `speed > 1` more *Action Phases* are added using the same initiative order, until no participant is left with `speed` greater than the current *Action Phase* number. Then the process starts over with rolling of new iniative and starting a new *Action Turn*.\r\n\r\n#### Usage\r\n1. Add tokens to the *Turn Order* in any manner you prefer.\r\n2. Run `!epbattleman --start` to inialise the Battle Manager. This will sort the *Turn Order* and create marker entries for *Action Phase* and *Action Turn* boundaries. These have the form `|Round x|Phase y|`. *From now on, do NOT use any of the Roll20 Turn Order functions anymore, as they will interfere the Battle Manager's state!*\r\n3. Proceed from character to character using `!epbattleman --next`. Characters without sufficient `speed` for the next *Action Phase* whill be dropped from the *Turn Order* as you go, but they are stored internally by the Battle Manager and will be added again at the beginning of the next *Action Turn*. At the beginning of the next *Action Turn* the Battle Manager will automatically roll new *Initiative* for all Tokens that have a Character Sheet associated with them.\r\n4. Once the battle is over, run `!epbattleman --end` to clear the Battle Manager's state. It will also tell you how long the battle took in realtime, as well as the number of rounds and phases.\r\n\r\nIf you need to **add** or **remove** charaters during an ongoing battle, you *must* use the the commands `!epbattleman --add` or `!epbattleman --drop` respectively. Using any other mechanism will pollute the Battle Managers internal state and you will see some strange behaviour.\r\n\r\nIf you accidentally use the normal `Next` button or manually add or remove tokens from an ongoing battle, the script will output a warning message to the chat. This warning message also contains a `reset` button, which you can use to invoke `!epbattleman --reset`, thereby undoing your inconsistency-introducing change.\r\n\r\n#### Recommended Macros\r\n\r\n- **BStart**: `!epbattleman --start`\r\n- **BNext**: `!epbattleman --next`\r\n- **BEnd**: `!epbattleman --end`\r\n- **BAdd**: `!epbattleman --add`\r\n- **BDrop**: `!epbattleman --drop`\r\n\r\n*In [Roll20 ES](https://github.com/SSStormy/roll20-enhancement-suite) Format*:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"schema_version\": 2,\r\n    \"macros\": [\r\n        {\r\n            \"attributes\": {\r\n                \"action\": \"!epbattleman --start\",\r\n                \"istokenaction\": false,\r\n                \"name\": \"BStart\",\r\n                \"visibleto\": \"\"\r\n            },\r\n            \"macrobar\": {\r\n                \"color\": null,\r\n                \"name\": null\r\n            }\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n            \"attributes\": {\r\n                \"action\": \"!epbattleman --next\",\r\n                \"istokenaction\": false,\r\n                \"name\": \"BNext\",\r\n                \"visibleto\": \"\"\r\n            },\r\n            \"macrobar\": {\r\n                \"color\": null,\r\n                \"name\": null\r\n            }\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n            \"attributes\": {\r\n                \"action\": \"!epbattleman --end\",\r\n                \"istokenaction\": false,\r\n                \"name\": \"BEnd\",\r\n                \"visibleto\": \"\"\r\n            },\r\n            \"macrobar\": {\r\n                \"color\": null,\r\n                \"name\": null\r\n            }\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n            \"attributes\": {\r\n                \"action\": \"!epbattleman --add\",\r\n                \"istokenaction\": false,\r\n                \"name\": \"BAdd\",\r\n                \"visibleto\": \"\"\r\n            },\r\n            \"macrobar\": {\r\n                \"color\": null,\r\n                \"name\": null\r\n            }\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n            \"attributes\": {\r\n                \"action\": \"!epbattleman --drop\",\r\n                \"istokenaction\": false,\r\n                \"name\": \"BDrop\",\r\n                \"visibleto\": \"\"\r\n            },\r\n            \"macrobar\": {\r\n                \"color\": null,\r\n                \"name\": null\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Character Cleaner\r\n**Command**: `!epclean`\r\n\r\nThe Character Cleaner removes or resets sections of a Character Sheet that are not taken along during the **Egocast** or **Backup** procedure. This includes *Active Morph*, *Gear* (except *Software*), and *Armour* totals, as well as *Damage* and *Wounds*. *Egocast* and *Backup* behave similar in every way, except that during a backup the Character Sheet is renamed in order to differentiate it from the \"live\" sheet. You *should*, thus, run the *backup* command on a **copy** of the \"live\" sheet!\r\n\r\n#### Usage\r\n\r\n##### Egocast\r\n1. Select a token representing the *target* Character Sheet.\r\n2. Run `!epclean --egocast`.\r\n\r\n##### Backup\r\n1. Create a copy of the *target* Character Sheet.\r\n2. Drag the copy onto a map to get a token for it. *(Double check that the token actually points to the new sheet, not the old one!)*\r\n3. Select that token.\r\n4. Run `!epclean --backup`.\r\n5. Delete the token from the map and archive the backup sheet.\r\n\r\nOptionally, you can also change the **prefix** the *backup* commands adds to the sheet name. To do so, invoke the backup command like `!epclean --backup --prefix <some prefix>` instead.\r\n\r\nAs an alternative to using the UI for duplicating the sheet, the following API script (found on [Roll20 Forums](https://app.roll20.net/forum/post/5687127/duplicate-character-sheet-plus-linked-token-script/?pageforid=5687407)) also works, and has the advantage that it properly relinks the token to the new sheet. Invoke it with `!dup-char-by-token`.\r\n```javascript\r\non('ready',()=>{\r\n    const simpleObj = (o)=>JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(o));\r\n    const getCleanImgsrc = (imgsrc) => {\r\n        let parts = imgsrc.match(/(.*\\/images\\/.*)(thumb|med|original|max)([^?]*)(\\?[^?]+)?$/);\r\n        if(parts) {\r\n            return parts[1]+'thumb'+parts[3]+(parts[4]?parts[4]:`?${Math.round(Math.random()*9999999)}`);\r\n        }\r\n        return;\r\n    };\r\n    const resetAttrs = {\"damage\": 0, \"wounds\": 0};\r\n    const duplicateCharacter = (o) => {\r\n        let c = simpleObj(o.character);\r\n        let oldCid = o.character.id;\r\n        delete c.id;\r\n        c.name=`(COPY) ${c.name}`;\r\n        c.avatar=getCleanImgsrc(c.avatar)||'';\r\n\r\n        let newC = createObj('character',c);\r\n        \r\n        _.each(findObjs({type:'attribute',characterid:oldCid}),(a)=>{\r\n            let sa = simpleObj(a);\r\n            delete sa.id;\r\n            delete sa._type;\r\n            delete sa._characterid;\r\n            sa.characterid = newC.id;\r\n            if (sa.name in resetAttrs) {\r\n                sa.current = resetAttrs[sa.name];\r\n            }\r\n            createObj('attribute',sa);\r\n        });\r\n        _.each(findObjs({type:'ability',characterid:oldCid}),(a)=>{\r\n            let sa = simpleObj(a);\r\n            delete sa.id;\r\n            delete sa._type;\r\n            delete sa._characterid;\r\n            sa.characterid = newC.id;\r\n            createObj('ability',sa);\r\n        });\r\n        let oldBar1 = o.token.get('bar1_link');\r\n        //log(\"Bar1 \" + oldBar1);\r\n        let oldBar2 = o.token.get('bar2_link');\r\n        //log(\"Bar2 \" + oldBar2);\r\n        let oldBar3 = o.token.get('bar3_link');\r\n        //log(\"Bar3 \" + oldBar3);\r\n        let findNewAttr = (oldBar) => {\r\n            if (oldBar != undefined) {\r\n                if (oldBar.startsWith(\"sheetattr\")) {\r\n                    return oldBar;

Determine DV (`<DV>`), applicable armour if any (`<Armour>` from *Kinetic*, *Energy*, *Untyped*, e.g. Psi Damage, *None*, e.g. a critical success), and AP if any (`<AP>`).\r\n3. Run `!epchar --damage <DV> --armour <Armour> --ap <AP>` or, if you want only the GM to see the output, `!epchar --damage <DV> --armour <Armour> --ap <AP> --output GM`, replacing the variables as determined in step 2.\r\n4. Sometimes the response of the script will tell you to roll something else, based on the result of damage application. In that case you should do so, by clicking the provided roll-button.\r\n\r\n##### Stress\r\n1. Select the token you want to apply stress to.\r\n2. Determine SV (`<SV>`).\r\n3. Run `!epchar --stress <SV>` or, if you want only the GM to see the output, `!epchar --stress <SV> --output GM`, replacing the variables as determined in step 2.\r\n4. Sometimes the response of the script will tell you to pick new derangements or upgrade existing ones, as well as roll something else, all which you should do.\r\n\r\n#### Recommended Macros\r\n\r\n- **DV**: `!epchar --damage ?{DV} --armour ?{Apply Armour|None|Energy|Kinetic|Untyped} --ap ?{AP|0}`\r\n- **GMDV**: `!epchar --damage ?{DV} --armour ?{Apply Armour|None|Energy|Kinetic|Untyped}  --ap ?{AP|0} --output GM`\r\n- **SV**: `!epchar --stress ?{SV}`\r\n\r\n*In [Roll20 ES](https://github.com/SSStormy/roll20-enhancement-suite) Format*:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"schema_version\": 2,\r\n    \"macros\": [\r\n        {\r\n            \"attributes\": {\r\n                \"action\": \"!epchar --damage ?{DV} --armour ?{Apply Armour|None|Energy|Kinetic|Untyped} --ap ?{AP|0}\",\r\n                \"istokenaction\": true,\r\n                \"name\": \"DV\",\r\n                \"visibleto\": \"all\"\r\n            }\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n            \"attributes\": {\r\n                \"action\": \"!epchar --stress ?{SV}\",\r\n                \"istokenaction\": true,\r\n                \"name\": \"SV\",\r\n                \"visibleto\": \"all\"\r\n            }\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n            \"attributes\": {\r\n                \"action\": \"!epchar --damage ?{DV} --armour ?{Apply Armour|None|Energy|Kinetic|Untyped}  --ap ?{AP|0} --output GM\",\r\n                \"istokenaction\": true,\r\n                \"name\": \"GMDV\",\r\n                \"visibleto\": \"\"\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### GM Tools\r\n**Command**: `!epgmtools`\r\n\r\nA very simple command that collects information about skill values of a set of characters and sends them to the GM in sorted order. While in more static games like D&D simple bookkeeping would be sufficient to keep track of common skills like Perception, in EP those values are affected by traumas and wounds. Thus is can be convenient to get a quick snapshot of the state of your party with respect to certain skills. Particularly Perception and Kinesics are good candidates for this as they could be used in a \"passive\" manner without the players necessarily knowing about a failed check.\r\n\r\n#### Usage\r\n\r\n##### On Tokens\r\n1. Select all relevant tokens (e.g., all player tokens).\r\n2. Run `!epgmtools --best-mod --skill-name <SkillName>`, replacing `<SkillName>` with `Perception` or `Kinesics, for example.`\r\n\r\n##### By Name\r\nSee macro below.\r\nYou can also specify character ids instead of names as trailing arguments, but it's not quite as convenient, perhaps.\r\n\r\n#### Recommended Macros\r\n\r\n- **CharSkill**: `!epgmtools --best-mod --skill-name ?{Skill Name|Perception|Kinesics}` and append one instance of `--char-name <CharName>` for each player character in your group with name `<CharName>`\r\n\r\n### Group Rolls\r\n**Command**: `!epgroup-roll`\r\n\r\nThe Group Rolls scripts enables rolling basic EP rolls like *Fray/2* or *Initiative*, as well as arbitrary *Active Skills*, for a group of selected token. For all rolls, a modifier to the roll must also be specified.\r\n\r\n#### Usage\r\n\r\n##### Fray/2\r\n1. Select all relevant tokens.\r\n2. Run `!epgmtools --fray-halved --mod <Mod>`, with `<Mod>` the GM's modifier on the roll.\r\n\r\n##### Skill\r\n1. Select all relevant tokens.\r\n2. Run `!epgmtools --skill <SkillName> --mod <Mod>`, with `<SkillName>` the name of the skill to roll, `<Mod>` the GM's modifier on the roll.\r\n\r\n##### Initiative\r\n1. Select all relevant tokens.\r\n2. Run `!epgmtools --ini`.\r\n\r\nRolled results go to the tracker automatically.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Recommended Macros\r\n\r\n- **GroupIni**: `!epgroup-roll --ini`\r\n- **GroupFray/2**: `!epgroup-roll --fray-halved --mod ?{Mod|0}`\r\n- **GroupSkill**: `!epgroup-roll --skill ?{Skill|Fray} --mod ?{Mod|0}`\r\n\r\n*In [Roll20 ES](https://github.com/SSStormy/roll20-enhancement-suite) Format*:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"schema_version\": 2,\r\n    \"macros\": [\r\n        {\r\n            \"attributes\": {\r\n                \"action\": \"!epgroup-roll --ini\",\r\n                \"istokenaction\": false,\r\n                \"name\": \"GroupIni\",\r\n                \"visibleto\": \"\"\r\n            },\r\n            \"macrobar\": {\r\n                \"color\": null,\r\n                \"name\": null\r\n            }\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n            \"attributes\": {\r\n                \"action\": \"!epgroup-roll --fray-halved --mod ?{Mod|0}\",\r\n                \"istokenaction\": false,\r\n                \"name\": \"GroupFray/2\",\r\n                \"visibleto\": \"\"\r\n            },\r\n            \"macrobar\": {\r\n                \"color\": null,\r\n                \"name\": null\r\n            }\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n            \"attributes\": {\r\n                \"action\": \"!epgroup-roll --skill ?{Skill|Fray} --mod ?{Mod|0}\",\r\n                \"istokenaction\": false,\r\n                \"name\": \"GroupSkill\",\r\n                \"visibleto\": \"\"\r\n            },\r\n            \"macrobar\": {\r\n                \"color\": null,\r\n                \"name\": null\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Special Rolls\r\n**Command**: `!epspecialroll`\r\n\r\nThe Special Rolls script allows EP *Success* or *Damage* rolls, without involving a character sheet. While this is mostly meant for being used via buttons generated from *EPCompendium* output, one could also create macros for custom weapons or custom rolls, for example.\r\n\r\n#### Usage\r\n\r\n##### Success\r\nThe Success template has the form\r\n```text\r\n<Character>\r\n-----------\r\n<Label>\r\n    <SubLabel>\r\n1d100 vs <Target>\r\n[Result]\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo generate a Success template from the Special Rolls script, run `!epspecialrolls --success --target <Target>`, picking `<Target>` to be the target number including any modifiers.\r\n\r\nWhile `<Character>` is always \"API\" when generated from this script, you may specify both `--label <Label>` and `--sublabel <SubLabel>` arbitrarily when invoking it. If no values are given, the subtitle will read \"Success Roll\".\r\n\r\n\r\n##### Damage\r\nThe Damage template has the form\r\n```text\r\n<Character>\r\n-----------\r\n<Label>\r\n    <SubLabel>\r\nInflicts: [DmgFormula] DV <DamageType>\r\n<AP> AP or ignore if critical success\r\n```\r\nwhere `[DamageFormula]` is `<DamageDice>d10/<DamageDiv> + DamageConst`.\r\n\r\nTo generate a Damage template from the Special Rolls script, run `!epspecialrolls --damage --damage-dice <DamageDice> --damage-div <DamageDiv> --damage-const <DamageConst> --damage-type <DamageType> --ap <AP>`. The allowed values for `<DamageType>` are \"Kinetic\" and \"Energy\", and it will default to \"Unspecified\". `<AP>` simply takes the *Armour Penetration* value as expected.\r\n\r\nSimilar to above, while `<Character>` is always \"API\" when generated from this script, you may specify `--label <Label>` arbitrarily when invoking it. If no values are given, the subtitle will read \"Damage Roll\". Values for `--sublabel` are ignored in the Damage variant.\r\n\r\n#### Recommended Macros\r\nNone, just use the *EPCompendium* buttons.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Token Setup\r\n**Command**: `!eptoken`\r\n\r\nThe Token Setup script manages EP-related token abilities. It can generate these abilities for *Initiative*, *Fray/2*, and any skill.\r\nIt can also be used to clear the existing token abilities.\r\n\r\n#### Usage\r\n\r\n##### Setup\r\n1. Select all relevant tokens.\r\n2. Run `!eptoken --ini`, to add an *Initiative* token ability.\r\nOr run `!eptoken --fray`, to add an *Fray* token ability.\r\nOr run `!eptoken --fray-halved`, to add an *Fray/2* token ability.\r\nOr run `!eptoken --skill <SkillName>`, to add an `<SkillName>` token ability.\r\nOr run a combination of the above, for example `!eptoken --ini --fray`.\r\n\r\nNormally, the script does not override existing token abilities. This behaviour can be changed by specifiying `--force`.\r\n\r\n##### Cleanup\r\n1. Select all relevant tokens.\r\n2. Run `!eptoken --clear`, to delete all token abilities.\r\n\r\n#### Recommended Macros\r\n\r\n- **TokenActions**: `!eptoken --fray --fray-halved --ini`\r\n- **TokenSkill**: `!eptoken --skill ?{Skill|Perception}`\r\n\r\nIf you are using *The Aaron*'s [TokenMod](https://github.com/shdwjk/Roll20API/blob/master/TokenMod/TokenMod.js) script (as you should ;), I also recommend\r\n**TokenSetup**: `!token-mod --on showname --set bar1_link|death_rating bar2_link|wounds bar3_link|damage`\r\n\r\n*Note that in EP you should always link tokens to sheets, as otherwise you can't keep track of wounds and traumas, which affect subsequent rolls.*\r\n\r\n*In [Roll20 ES](https://github.com/SSStormy/roll20-enhancement-suite) Format*:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"schema_version\": 2,\r\n    \"macros\": [\r\n        {\r\n            \"attributes\": {\r\n                \"action\": \"!eptoken --fray --fray-halved --ini\",\r\n                \"istokenaction\": false,\r\n                \"name\": \"TokenActions\",\r\n                \"visibleto\": \"\"\r\n            }\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n            \"attributes\": {\r\n                \"action\": \"!token-mod --on showname --set bar1_link|death_rating bar2_link|wounds bar3_link|damage\",\r\n                \"istokenaction\": false,\r\n                \"name\": \"TokenSetup\",\r\n                \"visibleto\": \"\"\r\n            }\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n            \"attributes\": {\r\n                \"action\": \"!eptoken --skill ?{Skill|Perception}\",\r\n                \"istokenaction\": false,\r\n                \"name\": \"TokenSkill\",\r\n                \"visibleto\": \"all\"\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Compendium\r\n**Commands**: `!epcompendium-data`, `!epcompendium-export`, `!epcompendium-import`\r\n\r\nThe three Compendium scripts handle the [Eclipse Phase Compendium](https://github.com/Bathtor/EPCompendium) data (formats). For them to be of any use you must have some compendium data installed. Follow the instructions in the [Installation](#installation) section for the official data and/or feel free to add your own, for example by forking the compendium and generating your own data files.\r\n\r\nThe Data and Import script are typically used together, to first find some item in the compendium and then either simply display information about it, or import it into a character sheet.\r\n\r\nThe Export script doesn't interact with the compendium itself much, but uses the same data format. It can be used to export an item (currently only morphs) from a character sheet into a textual representation. The text always gets put into the **API Text Exchange** field on the **Options** tab in the Character sheet. *Note* that this field is only visible if the *Use API Script?* option under **Sheet Settings** is checked. There are two primary uses for this export feature. One is to simply move a custom item from one character to another. The other is use it to enrich the compendium with custom items for a campaign without having to go through the [Eclipse Phase Compendium](https://github.com/Bathtor/EPCompendium) code itself.\r\n\r\n#### Usage\r\n\r\n##### Search\r\nSay you are looking for an item where you vaguely know the name contains `<NAME>`, for example every pistol contains the term `Pistol`. To get a listing in the chat of all these items, ranked by \"match quality\", run:\r\n```text\r\n!epcompendium-data --search <NAME> --name-only --rank\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you want to search only a single category, for example *weapons*, replace `--search` with the name of the category, e.g. `--weapons Pistol`. Within a category you can also ask for a random entry via `*`, e.g. `--weapons *` will return a random weapon.\r\n\r\nWhenever you use the `--name-only` option, the output will be a list of item names followed by two symbols: Clicking on the `?` will pull up detailed info about the item (the same info you would get without the `--name-only` option). Clicking on the `⤺` will import the item into the character sheets of all currently selected tokens. The import option is also available on the detailed view.\r\n\r\n##### Multi-Search\r\nYou can also search for more than one item at a time, and produce a list of best matches. To so for search terms `<TERM1>`, `<TERM2>`, `<TERM3>` run:\r\n```text\r\n!epcompendium-data --multi-search -- <TERM1>,<TERM2>,<TERM3>`\r\n```\r\nThe output will have the format `<TERM> -> <BEST RESULT>`, if at least one result was found.\r\nThis feature is used by the EP Sheet to create a quick list of morph *Enhancements*, for example.\r\n\r\n##### Import\r\nThere are multiple ways to import data into character sheets associated with selected tokens. The basic command is something like:\r\n```text\r\n!epcompendium-import --<CATEGORY> <EXACT NAME>\r\n```\r\nSince typing this out for every item would be pretty error prone and tedious, the following alternative methods are recommended instead:\r\n\r\n1. Use the import (`⤺`) buttons on search output as described above.\r\n2. Use the macros generated with every [EP Compendium Release](https://github.com/Bathtor/EPCompendium/releases).\r\n3. To import a custom item from the **API Text Exchange** field use `!epcompendium-import --from-sheet` instead. You don't have to specify the item category in this case, as the format used for this is self-describing. This, however, also means that you can't simply c&p things between the Compendium Script and the **API Text Exchange** field. However, the export and import formats match.\r\n\r\n##### Export\r\nCurrently, the script only supports exporting the currently active morph instance.\r\n\r\n1. Select all relevant tokens. (They must have an active morph!)\r\n2. Run `!epcompendium-export --morph`.\r\n3. Go to the **API Text Exchange** field on the **Options** tab in the Character sheet and c&p the text there to where you need it, e.g. another sheet where you want to import this morph model.\r\n\r\n#### Recommended Macros\r\n\r\n- **Search**: `!epcompendium-data --search ?{Search for} --name-only --rank`\r\n- **SheetImport**: `!epcompendium-import --from-sheet`\r\n- **SheetExport**: `!epcompendium-export --morph`\r\n- **RandomDerangement**: `!epcompendium-import --derangement * --duration [[floor(1d10/2)]]`\r\n\r\nPlus all the macros generated for each [EP Compendium Release](https://github.com/Bathtor/EPCompendium/releases).\r\n\r\n*In [Roll20 ES](https://github.com/SSStormy/roll20-enhancement-suite) Format*:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"schema_version\": 2,\r\n    \"macros\": [\r\n        {\r\n            \"attributes\": {\r\n                \"action\": \"!epcompendium-data --search ?{Search for} --name-only --rank\",\r\n                \"istokenaction\": false,\r\n                \"name\": \"Search\",\r\n                \"visibleto\": \"all\"\r\n            },\r\n            \"macrobar\": {\r\n                \"color\": null,\r\n                \"name\": null\r\n            }\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n            \"attributes\": {\r\n                \"action\": \"!epcompendium-import --from-sheet\",\r\n                \"istokenaction\": true,\r\n                \"name\": \"SheetImport\",\r\n                \"visibleto\": \"all\"\r\n            }\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n            \"attributes\": {\r\n                \"action\": \"!epcompendium-import --derangement * --duration [[floor(1d10/2)]]\",\r\n                \"istokenaction\": false,\r\n                \"name\": \"RandomDerangement\",\r\n                \"visibleto\": \"\"\r\n            }\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n            \"attributes\": {\r\n                \"action\": \"!epcompendium-export --morph\",\r\n                \"istokenaction\": false,\r\n                \"name\": \"SheetExport\",\r\n                \"visibleto\": \"\"\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n    ]\r\n}\r\n```\r\n",

Convenient for the improvising GM, who doesn&#39;t have an NPC ready to import, but still needs it to shoot something, for example.</li>\n<li><strong>Token Setup</strong> (<code>!eptoken</code>) generate token abilities for skills, <em>Fray/2</em>, or <em>Initiative</em>.</li>\n<li><strong>Compendium</strong> manages data from the <a href=\"https://github.com/Bathtor/EPCompendium\">Eclipse Phase Compendium</a>:\n\n<ul>\n<li><em>Data</em> (<code>!epcompendium-data</code>) manages search, lookups, and display of compendium data to the chat.</li>\n<li><em>Export</em> (<code>!epcompendium-export</code>) can export custom morphs in a Compendium-compatible format, so they can be imported into other character sheets.</li>\n<li><em>Import</em> (<code>!epcompendium-import</code>) manages character, trait, morph, and item imports.</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Installation</h2>\n\n<h3>Prerequisites</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>You must be a <strong>Pro</strong> subscriber of Roll20 to use API scripts in general, and this script in particular.</li>\n<li>You&#39;ll need a recent version of the <a href=\"https://github.com/Bathtor/EPSheet\">Eclipse Phase 1E sheet</a>. I&#39;ll try to be clear in the documentation, which script version works with which sheet version, but generally the latest release of each should always work together. And if you picked the wrong versions, it should complain and not break anything.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Installation</h3>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Open the <strong>raw</strong> text of the latest release of the script. At the time of writing that is <a href=\"https://github.com/Bathtor/EPSheet/releases/download/script-v1.0.2/ep-script.js\">v1.0.2</a>.</li>\n<li>Copy <em>all</em> the text -- <strong>Ctrl+A</strong> followed by <strong>Ctrl+C</strong> (<strong>Cmd+A</strong>, <strong>Cmd+C</strong> on a Mac)</li>\n<li>Go to the API Script page for your Roll20 campaign</li>\n<li>Paste the text into a new script, or override an older version if updating. Don&#39;t forget to give it a sensible name, e.g. <code>epscript.js</code>!</li>\n<li>Save the script</li>\n<li>Leave the Roll20 API Script page open, and open up your campaign view in a different tab/window. That should cause your sandbox to spin up. If no errors are reported, you should be good to go.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>EPCompendium</h4>\n\n<p>If you would like access to the EPCompendium-related features, you must also install the data script for the compendium. Follow the same procedure as above for the latest release of the EPCompendium, <a href=\"https://github.com/Bathtor/EPCompendium/releases/tag/v6.0.0\">v6.0.0</a> at the time of writing. Each Compendium release also contains a number of macros prepared to use with the script that you can just c&amp;p into your campaign.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Note</strong> that there&#39;s a load time dependency between the compendium script and the companion script, so make sure that the compendium script&#39;s tab is to the right of the companion script&#39;s.</p>\n\n<h4>Updating</h4>\n\n<p>If you need to update one of the script installed above, simply follow the same instructions as for a normal installation. Do make sure, that you always override old script versions, and never have two versions running in parallel!</p>\n\n<h2>Command Descriptions</h2>\n\n<h3>Battle Manager</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Command</strong>: <code>!epbattleman</code></p>\n\n<p>The EP Battle Manager deals with EP&#39;s hierarchical combat timing structure based on <em>Action Turns</em> and <em>Action Phases</em> in Roll20&#39;s Turn Order mechanism. Each <em>Action Turn</em> begins by rolling iniative. Then every participant may take perform actions in the iniative order in the first <em>Action Phase</em>. For participants with <code>speed &gt; 1</code> more <em>Action Phases</em> are added using the same initiative order, until no participant is left with <code>speed</code> greater than the current <em>Action Phase</em> number. Then the process starts over with rolling of new iniative and starting a new <em>Action Turn</em>.</p>\n\n<h4>Usage</h4>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Add tokens to the <em>Turn Order</em> in any manner you prefer.</li>\n<li>Run <code>!epbattleman --start</code> to inialise the Battle Manager. This will sort the <em>Turn Order</em> and create marker entries for <em>Action Phase</em> and <em>Action Turn</em> boundaries. These have the form <code>|Round x|Phase y|</code>. <em>From now on, do NOT use any of the Roll20 Turn Order functions anymore, as they will interfere the Battle Manager&#39;s state!</em></li>\n<li>Proceed from character to character using <code>!epbattleman --next</code>. Characters without sufficient <code>speed</code> for the next <em>Action Phase</em> whill be dropped from the <em>Turn Order</em> as you go, but they are stored internally by the Battle Manager and will be added again at the beginning of the next <em>Action Turn</em>. At the beginning of the next <em>Action Turn</em> the Battle Manager will automatically roll new <em>Initiative</em> for all Tokens that have a Character Sheet associated with them.</li>\n<li>Once the battle is over, run <code>!epbattleman --end</code> to clear the Battle Manager&#39;s state. It will also tell you how long the battle took in realtime, as well as the number of rounds and phases.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>If you need to <strong>add</strong> or <strong>remove</strong> charaters during an ongoing battle, you <em>must</em> use the the commands <code>!epbattleman --add</code> or <code>!epbattleman --drop</code> respectively. Using any other mechanism will pollute the Battle Managers internal state and you will see some strange behaviour.</p>\n\n<p>If you accidentally use the normal <code>Next</code> button or manually add or remove tokens from an ongoing battle, the script will output a warning message to the chat. This warning message also contains a <code>reset</code> button, which you can use to invoke <code>!epbattleman --reset</code>, thereby undoing your inconsistency-introducing change.</p>\n\n<h4>Recommended Macros</h4>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>BStart</strong>: <code>!epbattleman --start</code></li>\n<li><strong>BNext</strong>: <code>!epbattleman --next</code></li>\n<li><strong>BEnd</strong>: <code>!epbattleman --end</code></li>\n<li><strong>BAdd</strong>: <code>!epbattleman --add</code></li>\n<li><strong>BDrop</strong>: <code>!epbattleman --drop</code></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>In <a href=\"https://github.com/SSStormy/roll20-enhancement-suite\">Roll20 ES</a> Format</em>:<br/>\n<code>json<br/>\n{<br/>\n    &quot;schema_version&quot;: 2,<br/>\n    &quot;macros&quot;: [<br/>\n        {<br/>\n            &quot;attributes&quot;: {<br/>\n                &quot;action&quot;: &quot;!epbattleman --start&quot;,<br/>\n                &quot;istokenaction&quot;: false,<br/>\n                &quot;name&quot;: &quot;BStart&quot;,<br/>\n                &quot;visibleto&quot;: &quot;&quot;<br/>\n            },<br/>\n            &quot;macrobar&quot;: {<br/>\n                &quot;color&quot;: null,<br/>\n                &quot;name&quot;: null<br/>\n            }<br/>\n        },<br/>\n        {<br/>\n            &quot;attributes&quot;: {<br/>\n                &quot;action&quot;: &quot;!epbattleman --next&quot;,<br/>\n                &quot;istokenaction&quot;: false,<br/>\n                &quot;name&quot;: &quot;BNext&quot;,<br/>\n                &quot;visibleto&quot;: &quot;&quot;<br/>\n            },<br/>\n            &quot;macrobar&quot;: {<br/>\n                &quot;color&quot;: null,<br/>\n                &quot;name&quot;: null<br/>\n            }<br/>\n        },<br/>\n        {<br/>\n            &quot;attributes&quot;: {<br/>\n                &quot;action&quot;: &quot;!epbattleman --end&quot;,<br/>\n                &quot;istokenaction&quot;: false,<br/>\n                &quot;name&quot;: &quot;BEnd&quot;,<br/>\n                &quot;visibleto&quot;: &quot;&quot;<br/>\n            },<br/>\n            &quot;macrobar&quot;: {<br/>\n                &quot;color&quot;: null,<br/>\n                &quot;name&quot;: null<br/>\n            }<br/>\n        },<br/>\n        {<br/>\n            &quot;attributes&quot;: {<br/>\n                &quot;action&quot;: &quot;!epbattleman --add&quot;,<br/>\n                &quot;istokenaction&quot;: false,<br/>\n                &quot;name&quot;: &quot;BAdd&quot;,<br/>\n                &quot;visibleto&quot;: &quot;&quot;<br/>\n            },<br/>\n            &quot;macrobar&quot;: {<br/>\n                &quot;color&quot;: null,<br/>\n                &quot;name&quot;: null<br/>\n            }<br/>\n        },<br/>\n        {<br/>\n            &quot;attributes&quot;: {<br/>\n                &quot;action&quot;: &quot;!epbattleman --drop&quot;,<br/>\n                &quot;istokenaction&quot;: false,<br/>\n                &quot;name&quot;: &quot;BDrop&quot;,<br/>\n                &quot;visibleto&quot;: &quot;&quot;<br/>\n            },<br/>\n            &quot;macrobar&quot;: {<br/>\n                &quot;color&quot;: null,<br/>\n                &quot;name&quot;: null<br/>\n            }<br/>\n        }<br/>\n    ]<br/>\n}<br/>\n</code></p>\n\n<h3>Character Cleaner</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Command</strong>: <code>!epclean</code></p>\n\n<p>The Character Cleaner removes or resets sections of a Character Sheet that are not taken along during the <strong>Egocast</strong> or <strong>Backup</strong> procedure. This includes <em>Active Morph</em>, <em>Gear</em> (except <em>Software</em>), and <em>Armour</em> totals, as well as <em>Damage</em> and <em>Wounds</em>. <em>Egocast</em> and <em>Backup</em> behave similar in every way, except that during a backup the Character Sheet is renamed in order to differentiate it from the &quot;live&quot; sheet. You <em>should</em>, thus, run the <em>backup</em> command on a <strong>copy</strong> of the &quot;live&quot; sheet!</p>\n\n<h4>Usage</h4>\n\n<h5>Egocast</h5>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Select a token representing the <em>target</em> Character Sheet.</li>\n<li>Run <code>!epclean --egocast</code>.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h5>Backup</h5>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Create a copy of the <em>target</em> Character Sheet.</li>\n<li>Drag the copy onto a map to get a token for it. <em>(Double check that the token actually points to the new sheet, not the old one!)</em></li>\n<li>Select that token.</li>\n<li>Run <code>!epclean --backup</code>.</li>\n<li>Delete the token from the map and archive the backup sheet.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Optionally, you can also change the <strong>prefix</strong> the <em>backup</em> commands adds to the sheet name. To do so, invoke the backup command like <code>!epclean --backup --prefix &lt;some prefix&gt;</code> instead.</p>\n\n<p>As an alternative to using the UI for duplicating the sheet, the following API script (found on <a href=\"https://app.roll20.net/forum/post/5687127/duplicate-character-sheet-plus-linked-token-script/?pageforid=5687407\">Roll20 Forums</a>) also works, and has the advantage that it properly relinks the token to the new sheet. Invoke it with <code>!dup-char-by-token</code>.<br/>\n``<code>javascript<br/>\non(&#39;ready&#39;,()=&gt;{<br/>\n    const simpleObj = (o)=&gt;JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(o));<br/>\n    const getCleanImgsrc = (imgsrc) =&gt;

While in more static games like D&amp;D simple bookkeeping would be sufficient to keep track of common skills like Perception, in EP those values are affected by traumas and wounds. Thus is can be convenient to get a quick snapshot of the state of your party with respect to certain skills. Particularly Perception and Kinesics are good candidates for this as they could be used in a &quot;passive&quot; manner without the players necessarily knowing about a failed check.</p>\n\n<h4>Usage</h4>\n\n<h5>On Tokens</h5>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Select all relevant tokens (e.g., all player tokens).</li>\n<li>Run <code>!epgmtools --best-mod --skill-name &lt;SkillName&gt;</code>, replacing <code>&lt;SkillName&gt;</code> with <code>Perception</code> or <code>Kinesics, for example.</code></li>\n</ol>\n\n<h5>By Name</h5>\n\n<p>See macro below.<br/>\nYou can also specify character ids instead of names as trailing arguments, but it&#39;s not quite as convenient, perhaps.</p>\n\n<h4>Recommended Macros</h4>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>CharSkill</strong>: <code>!epgmtools --best-mod --skill-name ?{Skill Name|Perception|Kinesics}</code> and append one instance of <code>--char-name &lt;CharName&gt;</code> for each player character in your group with name <code>&lt;CharName&gt;</code></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Group Rolls</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Command</strong>: <code>!epgroup-roll</code></p>\n\n<p>The Group Rolls scripts enables rolling basic EP rolls like <em>Fray/2</em> or <em>Initiative</em>, as well as arbitrary <em>Active Skills</em>, for a group of selected token.

While this is mostly meant for being used via buttons generated from <em>EPCompendium</em> output, one could also create macros for custom weapons or custom rolls, for example.</p>\n\n<h4>Usage</h4>\n\n<h5>Success</h5>\n\n<p>The Success template has the form<br/>\n```text</p>\n\n<h2></h2>\n\n<p>1d100 vs <br/>\n[Result]<br/>\n```</p>\n\n<p>To generate a Success template from the Special Rolls script, run <code>!epspecialrolls --success --target &lt;Target&gt;</code>, picking <code>&lt;Target&gt;</code> to be the target number including any modifiers.</p>\n\n<p>While <code>&lt;Character&gt;</code> is always &quot;API&quot; when generated from this script, you may specify both <code>--label &lt;Label&gt;</code> and <code>--sublabel &lt;SubLabel&gt;</code> arbitrarily when invoking it. If no values are given, the subtitle will read &quot;Success Roll&quot;.</p>\n\n<h5>Damage</h5>\n\n<p>The Damage template has the form<br/>\n```text</p>\n\n<h2></h2>\n\n<p>Inflicts: [DmgFormula] DV <br/>\n AP or ignore if critical success<br/>\n``<code><br/>\nwhere</code>[DamageFormula]<code>is</code>d10/ + DamageConst`.</p>\n\n<p>To generate a Damage template from the Special Rolls script, run <code>!epspecialrolls --damage --damage-dice &lt;DamageDice&gt; --damage-div &lt;DamageDiv&gt; --damage-const &lt;DamageConst&gt; --damage-type &lt;DamageType&gt; --ap &lt;AP&gt;</code>. The allowed values for <code>&lt;DamageType&gt;</code> are &quot;Kinetic&quot; and &quot;Energy&quot;, and it will default to &quot;Unspecified&quot;. <code>&lt;AP&gt;</code> simply takes the <em>Armour Penetration</em> value as expected.</p>\n\n<p>Similar to above, while <code>&lt;Character&gt;</code> is always &quot;API&quot; when generated from this script, you may specify <code>--label &lt;Label&gt;</code> arbitrarily when invoking it. If no values are given, the subtitle will read &quot;Damage Roll&quot;. Values for <code>--sublabel</code> are ignored in the Damage variant.</p>\n\n<h4>Recommended Macros</h4>\n\n<p>None, just use the <em>EPCompendium</em> buttons.</p>\n\n<h3>Token Setup</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Command</strong>: <code>!eptoken</code></p>\n\n<p>The Token Setup script manages EP-related token abilities. It can generate these abilities for <em>Initiative</em>, <em>Fray/2</em>, and any skill.<br/>\nIt can also be used to clear the existing token abilities.</p>\n\n<h4>Usage</h4>\n\n<h5>Setup</h5>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Select all relevant tokens.</li>\n<li>Run <code>!eptoken --ini</code>, to add an <em>Initiative</em> token ability.\nOr run <code>!eptoken --fray</code>, to add an <em>Fray</em> token ability.\nOr run <code>!eptoken --fray-halved</code>, to add an <em>Fray/2</em> token ability.\nOr run <code>!eptoken --skill &lt;SkillName&gt;</code>, to add an <code>&lt;SkillName&gt;</code> token ability.\nOr run a combination of the above, for example <code>!eptoken --ini --fray</code>.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Normally, the script does not override existing token abilities. This behaviour can be changed by specifiying <code>--force</code>.</p>\n\n<h5>Cleanup</h5>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Select all relevant tokens.</li>\n<li>Run <code>!eptoken --clear</code>, to delete all token abilities.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h4>Recommended Macros</h4>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>TokenActions</strong>: <code>!eptoken --fray --fray-halved --ini</code></li>\n<li><strong>TokenSkill</strong>: <code>!eptoken --skill ?{Skill|Perception}</code></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If you are using <em>The Aaron</em>&#39;s <a href=\"https://github.com/shdwjk/Roll20API/blob/master/TokenMod/TokenMod.js\">TokenMod</a> script (as you should ;), I also recommend<br/>\n<strong>TokenSetup</strong>: <code>!token-mod --on showname --set bar1_link|death_rating bar2_link|wounds bar3_link|damage</code></p>\n\n<p><em>Note that in EP you should always link tokens to sheets, as otherwise you can&#39;t keep track of wounds and traumas, which affect subsequent rolls.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>In <a href=\"https://github.com/SSStormy/roll20-enhancement-suite\">Roll20 ES</a> Format</em>:<br/>\n<code>json<br/>\n{<br/>\n    &quot;schema_version&quot;: 2,<br/>\n    &quot;macros&quot;: [<br/>\n        {<br/>\n            &quot;attributes&quot;: {<br/>\n                &quot;action&quot;: &quot;!eptoken --fray --fray-halved --ini&quot;,<br/>\n                &quot;istokenaction&quot;: false,<br/>\n                &quot;name&quot;: &quot;TokenActions&quot;,<br/>\n                &quot;visibleto&quot;: &quot;&quot;<br/>\n            }<br/>\n        },<br/>\n        {<br/>\n            &quot;attributes&quot;: {<br/>\n                &quot;action&quot;: &quot;!token-mod --on showname --set bar1_link|death_rating bar2_link|wounds bar3_link|damage&quot;,<br/>\n                &quot;istokenaction&quot;: false,<br/>\n                &quot;name&quot;: &quot;TokenSetup&quot;,<br/>\n                &quot;visibleto&quot;: &quot;&quot;<br/>\n            }<br/>\n        },<br/>\n        {<br/>\n            &quot;attributes&quot;: {<br/>\n                &quot;action&quot;: &quot;!eptoken --skill ?{Skill|Perception}&quot;,<br/>\n                &quot;istokenaction&quot;: false,<br/>\n                &quot;name&quot;: &quot;TokenSkill&quot;,<br/>\n                &quot;visibleto&quot;: &quot;all&quot;<br/>\n            }<br/>\n        }<br/>\n    ]<br/>\n}<br/>\n</code></p>\n\n<h3>Compendium</h3>\n\n<p><strong>Commands</strong>: <code>!epcompendium-data</code>, <code>!epcompendium-export</code>, <code>!epcompendium-import</code></p>\n\n<p>The three Compendium scripts handle the <a href=\"https://github.com/Bathtor/EPCompendium\">Eclipse Phase Compendium</a> data (formats). For them to be of any use you must have some compendium data installed. Follow the instructions in the <a href=\"#installation\">Installation</a> section for the official data and/or feel free to add your own, for example by forking the compendium and generating your own data files.</p>\n\n<p>The Data and Import script are typically used together, to first find some item in the compendium and then either simply display information about it, or import it into a character sheet.</p>\n\n<p>The Export script doesn&#39;t interact with the compendium itself much, but uses the same data format. It can be used to export an item (currently only morphs) from a character sheet into a textual representation. The text always gets put into the <strong>API Text Exchange</strong> field on the <strong>Options</strong> tab in the Character sheet. <em>Note</em> that this field is only visible if the <em>Use API Script?</em> option under <strong>Sheet Settings</strong> is checked. There are two primary uses for this export feature. One is to simply move a custom item from one character to another. The other is use it to enrich the compendium with custom items for a campaign without having to go through the <a href=\"https://github.com/Bathtor/EPCompendium\">Eclipse Phase Compendium</a> code itself.</p>\n\n<h4>Usage</h4>\n\n<h5>Search</h5>\n\n<p>Say you are looking for an item where you vaguely know the name contains <code>&lt;NAME&gt;</code>, for example every pistol contains the term <code>Pistol</code>. To get a listing in the chat of all these items, ranked by &quot;match quality&quot;, run:<br/>\n<code>text<br/>\n!epcompendium-data --search &lt;NAME&gt; --name-only --rank<br/>\n</code></p>\n\n<p>If you want to search only a single category, for example <em>weapons</em>, replace <code>--search</code> with the name of the category, e.g. <code>--weapons Pistol</code>. Within a category you can also ask for a random entry via <code>*</code>, e.g. <code>--weapons *</code> will return a random weapon.</p>\n\n<p>Whenever you use the <code>--name-only</code> option, the output will be a list of item names followed by two symbols: Clicking on the <code>?</code> will pull up detailed info about the item (the same info you would get without the <code>--name-only</code> option). Clicking on the <code>â¤º</code> will import the item into the character sheets of all currently selected tokens. The import option is also available on the detailed view.</p>\n\n<h5>Multi-Search</h5>\n\n<p>You can also search for more than one item at a time, and produce a list of best matches. To so for search terms <code>&lt;TERM1&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;TERM2&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;TERM3&gt;</code> run:<br/>\n<code>text<br/>\n!epcompendium-data --multi-search -- &lt;TERM1&gt;,&lt;TERM2&gt;,&lt;TERM3&gt;`<br/>\n</code><br/>\nThe output will have the format <code>&lt;TERM&gt; -&gt; &lt;BEST RESULT&gt;</code>, if at least one result was found.<br/>\nThis feature is used by the EP Sheet to create a quick list of morph <em>Enhancements</em>, for example.</p>\n\n<h5>Import</h5>\n\n<p>There are multiple ways to import data into character sheets associated with selected tokens. The basic command is something like:<br/>\n<code>text<br/>\n!epcompendium-import --&lt;CATEGORY&gt; &lt;EXACT NAME&gt;<br/>\n</code><br/>\nSince typing this out for every item would be pretty error prone and tedious, the following alternative methods are recommended instead:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Use the import (<code>â¤º</code>) buttons on search output as described above.</li>\n<li>Use the macros generated with every <a href=\"https://github.com/Bathtor/EPCompendium/releases\">EP Compendium Release</a>.</li>\n<li>To import a custom item from the <strong>API Text Exchange</strong> field use <code>!epcompendium-import --from-sheet</code> instead. You don&#39;t have to specify the item category in this case, as the format used for this is self-describing. This, however, also means that you can&#39;t simply c&amp;p things between the Compendium Script and the <strong>API Text Exchange</strong> field. However, the export and import formats match.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h5>Export</h5>\n\n<p>Currently, the script only supports exporting the currently active morph instance.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Select all relevant tokens. (They must have an active morph!)</li>\n<li>Run <code>!epcompendium-export --morph</code>.</li>\n<li>Go to the <strong>API Text Exchange</strong> field on the <strong>Options</strong> tab in the Character sheet and c&amp;p the text there to where you need it, e.g. another sheet where you want to import this morph model.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h4>Recommended Macros</h4>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Search</strong>: <code>!epcompendium-data --search ?{Search for} --name-only --rank</code></li>\n<li><strong>SheetImport</strong>: <code>!epcompendium-import --from-sheet</code></li>\n<li><strong>SheetExport</strong>: <code>!epcompendium-export --morph</code></li>\n<li><strong>RandomDerangement</strong>: <code>!epcompendium-import --derangement * --duration [[floor(1d10/2)]]</code></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Plus all the macros generated for each <a href=\"https://github.com/Bathtor/EPCompendium/releases\">EP Compendium Release</a>.</p>\n\n<p><em>In <a href=\"https://github.com/SSStormy/roll20-enhancement-suite\">Roll20 ES</a> Format</em>:<br/>\n<code>json<br/>\n{<br/>\n    &quot;schema_version&quot;: 2,<br/>\n    &quot;macros&quot;: [<br/>\n        {<br/>\n            &quot;attributes&quot;: {<br/>\n                &quot;action&quot;: &quot;!epcompendium-data --search ?{Search for} --name-only --rank&quot;,<br/>\n                &quot;istokenaction&quot;: false,<br/>\n                &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Search&quot;,<br/>\n                &quot;visibleto&quot;: &quot;all&quot;<br/>\n            },<br/>\n            &quot;macrobar&quot;: {<br/>\n                &quot;color&quot;: null,<br/>\n                &quot;name&quot;: null<br/>\n            }<br/>\n        },<br/>\n        {<br/>\n            &quot;attributes&quot;: {<br/>\n                &quot;action&quot;: &quot;!epcompendium-import --from-sheet&quot;,<br/>\n                &quot;istokenaction&quot;: true,<br/>\n                &quot;name&quot;: &quot;SheetImport&quot;,<br/>\n                &quot;visibleto&quot;: &quot;all&quot;<br/>\n            }<br/>\n        },<br/>\n        {<br/>\n            &quot;attributes&quot;: {<br/>\n                &quot;action&quot;: &quot;!epcompendium-import --derangement * --duration [[floor(1d10/2)]]&quot;,<br/>\n                &quot;istokenaction&quot;: false,<br/>\n                &quot;name&quot;: &quot;RandomDerangement&quot;,<br/>\n                &quot;visibleto&quot;: &quot;&quot;<br/>\n            }<br/>\n        },<br/>\n        {<br/>\n            &quot;attributes&quot;: {<br/>\n                &quot;action&quot;: &quot;!epcompendium-export --morph&quot;,<br/>\n                &quot;istokenaction&quot;: false,<br/>\n                &quot;name&quot;: &quot;SheetExport&quot;,<br/>\n                &quot;visibleto&quot;: &quot;&quot;<br/>\n            }<br/>\n        }<br/>\n    ]<br/>\n}<br/>\n</code></p>\n"

It is capable of not only counting 10s as two successes (or not, at the user's discretion), but also keeping track of other doubled successes as the result of charms, as well as handling rerolls.\n\nThe script's API command is '!exr'. For a complete command reference, type '!exr -help'.\n\nThe form a basic roll command takes is as follows: '!exr [no. of dice]# [command1] [arg1],[arg2],[..] [command2] [arg3],[arg4],[...]'. The user does not have to specify the success threshold, as it's always 7 in Exalted.\n\nThe script will double 10s (that is, count 10s as two successes) by default, but if the user needs to double other number values, they can use the '-d' command (case sensitive; see below), followed by a comma-delimited list of die results to double (in addition to 10, which, again, is already counted). If the user needs to *prevent* the script from doubling 10s, they can pass '-D', followed by a list of any values they would like to double. The '-d' and '-D' commands behave almost identically, save that the first automatically doubles 10s, and the other does not.\n\nIf the player needs to limit the number of doubled results they may accrue (as in the descriptions of some charms), they can attach 'l' to the end of either double command, immediately followed by the maximum number of doubles from which they can benefit (e.g., '-Dl5 9,7' to get a roll that does not double 10s, but doubles 9s and 7s, and of which the script will only count up to 5 doubled results).\n\nSome other charms in Exalted award the player rerolls. Most of these rerolls allow dice of a specified value to be rerolled once, and many allow the keeping of the higher result. This is the default behavior of the reroll command '-r'. Like the double command, this should be followed by a comma-delimited list of results to be rerolled. Some other effects award a *recursive* reroll, which allows the player to \"reroll [x]s until [x]s fail to appear.\" This is accomplished with the '-R' command, which functions identically to the other version, save that it will continue to reroll the passed values until there are no more left.\n\nThe reroll commands also have an 'l' modifier, but this one is used in conjunction with the '-r' command to force the script to keep the newer result, regardless of which result is higher (e.g., '-rl 6,5' to reroll 6s and 5s once each, and keep the new result, regardless of whether or not is is lower than the first).\n\nI'll continue to try to add new features as I playtest this with my group, but that's all for now!

HeroTracker will add a token to the Roll20 tracker multiple times to simulate this mechanic.\r\r### Syntax\r\r\r```!herotracker <parms>```\r\r```!ht <parms>```\r\r### Parameters:\r\r* **--help**\r* **--add**\r* **--remove**\r* **--id** <_token_id_>\r* **--tag** <_label_>\r* **--speed** <_number_>\r* **--dex** <_number_>\r* **--segment** <_number_>\r* **--speed_field** <_name_>\r* **--dex_field** <_name_>\r* **--back**\r\r---\rTo add tokens to the initiative tracker, select one or more tokens and then enter the chat command.\r\r\r```!ht --add```\r\r---\rTo remove entries, select one or more tokens and enter the chat command:\r\r```!ht --remove```\r\r---\rAlternately, you can specify a single token by its ID rather than selecting it. For example, to add a specific token, selected or not, enter this chat command:\r\r```!ht --add --id -L9sBx-soK0CQzQYCiFA --speed 5```\r\r---\rYou can also add a static label to the tracker by entering this chat command:\r\r```!ht --tag GAS-EFFECT --speed 4```\r\r---\rWhen adding a token, the speed and dex will be automatically derived from the token's attributes. However, you can override this by specifying your own speed and dex:\r\r```!ht --add --speed 6 --dex 18```\r\r---\rYou can add a token or label to just one segment by using this chat command:\r\r```!ht --add --tag POST --segment 13```\r\r---\rBecause the tracker can end up with a great many entries, it would normally create a cumbersome problem to cycle through the entire list should you accidentally move past a turn that isn't complete. As such, HeroTracker includes an option to rollback the tracker one turn:\r\r```!ht --back```\r\r---\rHero System begins a turn at segment 12. You can sort the tracker, with segment 12 at the top of the order, by using this command:\r\r```!ht --start```\r\r---\rHeroTracker uses dex to break ties by appending a decimal value to the token's speed. The value is just the dex subtracted from 100. If you do not want to use this feature, you can specify a dex of zero using this command:\r\r```!ht --add --dex 0```\r\r---\rBy default, HeroTracker uses the character sheet fields **SPD** and **DEX** to derive the speed and dex values. You can override and choose your own field names using the parameters **--speed_field** and **--dex_field**. This can also be used for characters that use a different attribute to break ties, such as ego based characters. The command would look like this:\r\r```!ht --add --dex_field EGO```\r\r---\r### Notes\r\rThe speed and dex of a selected token will be derived from the token's attributes **SPD** and **DEX** respectively.\r\rIf you specify a single token using the **--id** parameter, or create a custom label using the **--tag** parameter, you must also provide a speed or segment, and optionally a dex.\r\rEntries are added (collated) into the existing initiative order without resorting.  So if you were just starting segment 5 and a new character enters the combat, you can add the new character normally and the turn order will still be at the start of segment 5.  This also makes it easy to change a token's speed or dex in the middle of a turn if needed.  So, for example, if a character was effected by a Drain SPD attack that reduced his SPD to 2, you would select the character's token and enter the following command:\r\r```!ht --add --speed 2```\r\rThe following macro can be used to initiate combat with all selected tokens, beginning with segment 12:\r\r```\r!ht --add --tag SEGMENT --speed 12\r!ht --add --tag POST_RECOVERY --segment 13\r!ht --add --start\r```",

For example, to add a specific token, selected or not, enter this chat command:</p>\n\n<p><code>!ht --add --id -L9sBx-soK0CQzQYCiFA --speed 5</code></p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>You can also add a static label to the tracker by entering this chat command:</p>\n\n<p><code>!ht --tag GAS-EFFECT --speed 4</code></p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>When adding a token, the speed and dex will be automatically derived from the token&#39;s attributes. However, you can override this by specifying your own speed and dex:</p>\n\n<p><code>!ht --add --speed 6 --dex 18</code></p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>You can add a token or label to just one segment by using this chat command:</p>\n\n<p><code>!ht --add --tag POST --segment 13</code></p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Because the tracker can end up with a great many entries, it would normally create a cumbersome problem to cycle through the entire list should you accidentally move past a turn that isn&#39;t complete. As such, HeroTracker includes an option to rollback the tracker one turn:</p>\n\n<p><code>!ht --back</code></p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>Hero System begins a turn at segment 12. You can sort the tracker, with segment 12 at the top of the order, by using this command:</p>\n\n<p><code>!ht --start</code></p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>HeroTracker uses dex to break ties by appending a decimal value to the token&#39;s speed. The value is just the dex subtracted from 100. If you do not want to use this feature, you can specify a dex of zero using this command:</p>\n\n<p><code>!ht --add --dex 0</code></p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p>By default, HeroTracker uses the character sheet fields <strong>SPD</strong> and <strong>DEX</strong> to derive the speed and dex values. You can override and choose your own field names using the parameters <strong>--speed_field</strong> and <strong>--dex_field</strong>. This can also be used for characters that use a different attribute to break ties, such as ego based characters. The command would look like this:</p>\n\n<p><code>!ht --add --dex_field EGO</code></p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<h3>Notes</h3>\n\n<p>The speed and dex of a selected token will be derived from the token&#39;s attributes <strong>SPD</strong> and <strong>DEX</strong> respectively.</p>\n\n<p>If you specify a single token using the <strong>--id</strong> parameter, or create a custom label using the <strong>--tag</strong> parameter, you must also provide a speed or segment, and optionally a dex.</p>\n\n<p>Entries are added (collated) into the existing initiative order without resorting.  So if you were just starting segment 5 and a new character enters the combat, you can add the new character normally and the turn order will still be at the start of segment 5.  This also makes it easy to change a token&#39;s speed or dex in the middle of a turn if needed.  So, for example, if a character was effected by a Drain SPD attack that reduced his SPD to 2, you would select the character&#39;s token and enter the following command:</p>\n\n<p><code>!ht --add --speed 2</code></p>\n\n<p>The following macro can be used to initiate combat with all selected tokens, beginning with segment 12:</p>\n\n<p><code><br/>\n!ht --add --tag SEGMENT --speed 12<br/>\n!ht --add --tag POST_RECOVERY --segment 13<br/>\n!ht --add --start<br/>\n</code></p>\n"

This does not\rtake any damage resistances or immunities into account.\r\r### Hide Save Result\rThis property specifies whether the result of the trap's saving throws will be\rhidden from the players.\r\r### Miss - Half Damage\rThis property specifies whether victims of the trap will still take half damage,\reven if they avoided the trap. This does not take into account any special\rabilities such as Evasion.\r\r### Saving Throw\rIf the trap allows a saving throw, choose which saving throw it uses with this\rproperty and specify the save DC.\r\r### Spot DC\rThis property specifies the passive Perecption (10 + Perception skill modifier)\rneeded for a character to passively spot the trap.\r\r## Trap Spotter ability\r\rFor built-in sheets, This Trap Theme supports the Rogue's Trap Spotter talent. It works for any\rcharacter that has Trap Spotter in the Class Abilities section of their\rcharacter sheet.\r\rWhen the character approaches within 10' of a trap, they will\rautomatically get a perception check to try to notice the trap. The results\rof this check are sent to the GM. If the Perception check is successful, the\rplayers are also alerted about the trap's presence.\r\rThis ability only works with traps whose type is 'trap'. For the character's\rPerception check, it uses their Perception skill total on their character sheet,\rso it doesn't take into account any situational bonuses. It is the GM's job\rto account for any situational bonuses that might contribute to the hidden\rPerception check when the result is displayed to them.\r\r## Help\r\rMy scripts are provided 'as-is', without warranty of any kind, expressed or implied.\r\rThat said, if you experience any issues while using this script,\rneed help using it, or if you have a neat suggestion for a new feature,\rplease shoot me a PM:\rhttps://app.roll20.net/users/46544/ada-l\r\rWhen messaging me about an issue, please be sure to include any error messages that\rappear in your API Console Log, any configurations you've got set up for the\rscript in the VTT, and any options you've got set up for the script on your\rgame's API Scripts page.

Pathfinder doesn&#39;t normally<br/>\nuse passive perception, but the option is here for groups that want to use it.<br/>\nThis is set to &#39;no&#39; by default.</p>\n\n<h3>Attack Roll</h3>\n\n<p>This property specifies the trap&#39;s attack roll modifier and which type of AC it<br/>\ntargets (normal or touch), if it makes an attack roll.</p>\n\n<h3>Damage</h3>\n\n<p>A dice expression for the damage dealt by the trap on a hit.

It works for any<br/>\ncharacter that has Trap Spotter in the Class Abilities section of their<br/>\ncharacter sheet.</p>\n\n<p>When the character approaches within 10&#39; of a trap, they will<br/>\nautomatically get a perception check to try to notice the trap. The results<br/>\nof this check are sent to the GM. If the Perception check is successful, the<br/>\nplayers are also alerted about the trap&#39;s presence.</p>\n\n<p>This ability only works with traps whose type is &#39;trap&#39;. For the character&#39;s<br/>\nPerception check, it uses their Perception skill total on their character sheet,<br/>\nso it doesn&#39;t take into account any situational bonuses. It is the GM&#39;s job<br/>\nto account for any situational bonuses that might contribute to the hidden<br/>\nPerception check when the result is displayed to them.</p>\n\n<h2>Help</h2>\n\n<p>My scripts are provided &#39;as-is&#39;, without warranty of any kind, expressed or implied.</p>\n\n<p>That said, if you experience any issues while using this script,<br/>\nneed help using it, or if you have a neat suggestion for a new feature,<br/>\nplease shoot me a PM:<br/>\n<a href=\"https://app.roll20.net/users/46544/ada-l\">https://app.roll20.net/users/46544/ada-l</a></p>\n\n<p>When messaging me about an issue, please be sure to include any error messages that<br/>\nappear in your API Console Log, any configurations you&#39;ve got set up for the<br/>\nscript in the VTT, and any options you&#39;ve got set up for the script on your<br/>\ngame&#39;s API Scripts page.

Enabling the setting adds a menu where you can specify what menus should be created for all characters categorized by PC or NPC.\n- **Automatic Resource Tracking:** Will create handling for automatically tracking ammo for weapons and spell, ability, and item usages.\n- **Automatically handle HP changes:** Enabling this will autodeduct damage from temporary hp before affecting HP. It will also prevent healing from occurring beyond the max HP of a character.\n- **Maintain PC default tokens:** Enabling this option will bring up a table to set what attribute (by case insensitive name) each bar should link to and whether that bar should be visible to players or not. Having this option turned on will also update the default token of a character whenever there is a change made to that character (excluding movement and var value/max changes). NOTE: With this setting enabled, setting a token to represent a character will update the bar links and values to be synced appropriately. This will not be reflected in the token setup pop-up until you reload the menu. Exit the menu by hitting **CANCEL** (NOT **APPLY**) and your token will be set as the default token for that character and setup as per the settings in the config menu.\n- **Apply Condition/Buff statusmarkers:** Enabling this will apply the appropriate statusmarker to all tokens representing the buffed/conditioned character if that character is controlled by at least one player. You can designate statusmarkers to use for buffs on a per character basis by using the **!pfc --buffstatus** command while you have a single token selected or by passing a single character id after (e.g. **!pfc --buffstatus|@{Jord Strongbow|character_id}**). NOTE this setting will not work correctly unless Maintain PC default tokens is enabled\n###Current macro setup, auto attribute handling and command syntax:\n####Automatic Attribute Handling\n\n- **HP & Temp HP:** If this option is enabled in the config menu health deducted from a character's HP will be deducted from their temp hp first before being applied to their HP. Note this will not work with API applied HP changes (other than those caused by this script).\nMacro Setup\n\n- **Weapons:** Weapons can be setup to track ammo usage (according to # of attacks used, including usage of manyshot), other item usage, spell usage, ability usage, and custom attribute usage.\nAmmo Tracking: Setting the ammo field of a weapon to anything besides 1 tells the script that that weapon uses ammo. The script willgenerate the following field in the macro text of the weapon: ||ammo=?{Name of Ammunition Item}||. After the first time you answer this query, it will be replaced with your response.You can also manually put a different query in here to be prompted for what ammunition to use with each attack routine.\n- **Spell or Ability Tracking:** If a weapon is linked to a spell or ability (that has uses), an additional roll template field will be added to the macro that will display a button to outputthe spell card as well as buttons to increment, decrement, or custom adjust the number of spells used.\nSpells: A field similar to that for weapons linked to a spell will be added to all spells.\n- **Abilities:** A field similar to that for weapons linked to an ability will be added to all abilities that have uses.\ncustom attribute: Entering %%What you named the custom attribute%% into the description field (notes field for weapons) will cause the script to put a field similar to the spell or ability to allow you to adjust the quantity of it. This will only be created for those custom attributes that have a current/max comparison. This can also be used to add fields for spells,abilities, or items without having to directly edit the macro text.\nCommand syntax\n\n- **Item tracking:** !pfc --resource,item=Item Name,current=max OR +/-X OR X,max=+/-X OR X|characterid|characterid|...\n- **Ability tracking:** !pfc --resource,ability=Ability Name,current=max OR +/-X OR X|characterid|characterid|...\n- **Spell tracking:** !pfc --resource,spell=Spell Name,current=max OR +/-X OR X|characterid|characterid|...\n- **Custom Attribute tracking:** !pfc --resource,note=Custom Attribute Name,current=max OR +/-X OR X|characterid|characterid|...\n- **Whisper Adjusting:** !pfc --whisper,npc=public/private/swap,pc=public/private/swap,stats=public/private/swap|characerid|characterid|...\nAccess the Config Menu: !pfc --config\n- **Apply/Remove Buffs Conditions:** !pfc --apply,condition=all or part of a condtion name,buff=all or part of a buff name that has already been setup on the character,remove/swap|characterid|characterid|...\n- **Import Statblock:** !pfc --parse|characterid|characterid|characterid| OR !pfc --parse|{{statblock NEWCREATURE statblock NEW CREATURE ...}}\nCopy your statblock (pure text only - copy into a text editor first to clean off formatting) into the gmnotes of a fresh character or directly via chat, and then run the command. I have only tested the parser on pfsrd statblocks (and not many of those) so far, and hope to overcome the issues preventing multiple statblocks from being imported at once, as well as hopefully eventually allowing statblocks to be imported from chat.\nBuff statusmarker wizard: !pfc --buffstatus|characterid\nThe characterid is optional if you have a token representing a character selected. The command only works on a single character; having more than one token selected or passing more than one character id will only act on the first character in the list (this is unpredictable when using selected tokens).",

It lets you<br/>\ncreate graphical areas of effect for various spells and other powers, and then<br/>\nyour players can create these effects by drawing lines specifying their<br/>\nrange, origin, and angle. Areas of effect can be created from any graphic that<br/>\nyou have uploaded to your library.</p>\n\n<h2>AoE menu</h2>\n\n<p>When the script is installed, it creates a macro for all GMs of the game to<br/>\ndisplay its main menu in the chat. This macro is also visible and usable by all players<br/>\nin the game, but only GMs are allowed to save new areas of effect. Players can<br/>\nonly spawn them.</p>\n\n<h2>Creating Areas of effect</h2>\n\n<p>To create an area of effect, follow these steps:<br/>\n1. Place the graphic you want to create an effect out of onto the VTT.<br/>\n2. Draw a straight line over it from the origin of the effect to its end/edge.<br/>\n3. Select both the line and the graphic.<br/>\n4. Open the Areas of Effect menu using its macro and select <code>Save Effect</code>.<br/>\n5. Name the effect, and you&#39;re done!</p>\n\n<p>The effect will now appear in your list of saved areas of effect. Only GMs<br/>\ncan save areas of effect.</p>\n\n<h2>Viewing/Spawning Areas of Effect</h2>\n\n<p>To view the list of saved areas of effect, open the script&#39;s menu from its<br/>\nmacro and select <code>Apply an Effect</code>. The list will show each effect with<br/>\nits name, a preview of its graphic, and GMs will also have a button they can<br/>\nuse to delete effects.</p>\n\n<p>To spawn an area of effect from this list, follow these steps:<br/>\n1. Draw a straight line from the desired origin of the effect to its desired range.<br/>\n2. Select the line.<br/>\n3. Click the effect to apply to the line from the list of saved areas of effect.</p>\n\n<p>OR</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Select the token the effect originates from.</li>\n<li>Click the arrow button for the effect.</li>\n<li>Click the target token for the effect&#39;s endpoint.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Both GMs and players can spawn areas of effect!</p>\n\n<p><em>Note: Currently it is not possible to create effects from graphics purchased<br/>\nfrom the market place due to certain restrictions specified here:<br/>\n<a href=\"https://wiki.roll20.net/API:Objects#imgsrc\">https://wiki.roll20.net/API:Objects#imgsrc</a></em>and<em>avatar</em>property_restrictions</p>\n\n<p>However, you can download them from your Roll20 purchased assets library and<br/>\nthen upload them to your game in order to make use of them with this script ._</p>\n\n<h2>Help</h2>\n\n<p>My scripts are provided &#39;as-is&#39;, without warranty of any kind, expressed or implied.</p>\n\n<p>That said, if you experience any issues while using this script,<br/>\nneed help using it, or if you have a neat suggestion for a new feature,<br/>\nplease shoot me a PM:<br/>\n<a href=\"https://app.roll20.net/users/46544/ada-l\">https://app.roll20.net/users/46544/ada-l</a></p>\n\n<p>When messaging me about an issue, please be sure to include any error messages that<br/>\nappear in your API Console Log, any configurations you&#39;ve got set up for the<br/>\nscript in the VTT, and any options you&#39;ve got set up for the script on your<br/>\ngame&#39;s API Scripts page.

Using either the emojibubble console handout, or the available macros, GMs and players can select an emoji, which causes a small word-balloon with a single emoji adjacent to the selected token's top-right. Only graphic:tokens can be targeted or selected.\r\r## Installation\r\rOn installation in one-click, a handout (\"Emoji Bubble Console\") is created with the default collection of 60 emoji as buttons you can click to add to a selected token, and a reference appears in chat that opens the handout. The handout persists, and will be re-created if you delete it so you and your players can always find and use the console.\r\rIt also creates two macros: #Select_Emojibubble and #Target_Emojibubble. These also will be re-created if deleted. #Selected_Emojibubble is available to players, and provides a way to select an emoji from a drop-down instead of the console. #Target_Emojibubble is available to the GM only, and the macro has a target select and the drop-down, meaning a GM doesn't have to select a token beforehand. \r\r## Using Emojibubble\r\rSelect any token on any layer, then either use the console and click the emoji you want to append in the notes section, or fire the #Selected_Emojibubble macro and select an emoji from the drop-down. Provided it is a valid graphic token, Emojibubble will append a drawing object bubble and a text object with a single emoji offset from the token to make it appear like the token is speaking the emoji. To clear an emojibubble, press the \"Clear Emoji Bubble\" button on the Emojibubble Console, or use the #Select_Emojibubble macro and select the \"clear\" emoji option. If you select another emojibubble for a token that already has one, the former one is cleared and the new one is appended. You can delete emojibubbles manually without causing an error; but really, Emojibubble will clean up after itself most of the time, including across sessions. \r\rThe #Target_Emojibubble, for GM use only, provides a token-select prompt on being activated, then provides a drop down of all available emoji to select from. This provides a useful shortcut for GMs that may need to quickly target a token to emote without having to select and then use the console. It also has the clear option in its drop-down.\r\r## Adding Emoji to the Emoji List\r\rThe GM Notes portion, invisible to the players, is below the main part of the console in the notes. Clicking on \"Add Emoji\" opens a pop-up where you can paste any emoji you have copied from elsewhere. You then are prompted to provide a name reference to the particular emoji - this is the internal reference index (no two can have the same name, and picking a name of an existing emoji will replace that emoji) and helps if you want to use the API to activate emojibubble directly by calling the emojibubble object from another script. \r\rA link to a popular emoji listing site is provided for convenience and opens in a new window.\r\r## Removing Emoji from the Emoji List\r\rAlso in the GM Notes, there is an array of the same emoji as in the notes, but with a background that is dark gray. Clicking these will remove and emoji from the available list.  \r\r## Resetting the Emoji List\r\rJust in case you might have deleted most of the original emoji, and find you need to get a bunch back in a hurry, or made a mistake in deletion, the reset button sets the collection back to the default 60 that are provided when you first install Emojibubble. Unfortunately, there isn't an \"undo\" - if you accidentally delete a custom emoji you'll have to add it again. \r\r## Emojibubble Multi-Select\r\rA GM or player with multiple tokens can select them all simultaneously and either use the macro #Selected_Emojibubble or the Emoji Bubble Console buttons to set multiple tokens to express the same emoji. \r",

(Default: `#ff00ff`) Any color format that works for TokenMod works (except `transparent`).\r* `--c <color>` -- Shorthand for `--color`.\r* `--radius <radius>` -- Sets the radius of the created aura. The number is relative to the page just like regular auras, usually 5 for one square. (Default: `0`, or just on the token.)\r* `--r <radius>` -- Shorthand for `--radius`.\r* `--square` -- Sets the created aura to be square. (Default: `round`)\r* `--s` -- Shorthand for `--square`.\r* `--ids <token id> [token id ...]` -- a list of token ids to create auras for.\r\r```!gm-aura --color #ff0000 --radius 10 --square ```\r\r**Note:** You can create multi-line commands by enclosing the arguments after !gm-aura in `{{` and `}}`.\r\r```\r!gm-aura {{\r  --c rgb(.7,.7,.3)\r  --r 15\r}}\r```\r\r**Note:** You can use inline rolls as part of your command\r\r```\r!gm-aura --radius [[1d3*5]]\r```\r\r### Colors\r\rColors can be specified in multiple formats:\r\r* **HTML Color** -- This is 6 or 3 hexidecimal digits, optionally prefaced by `#`. Digits in a 3 digit hexidecimal color are doubled. All of the following are the same: `#ff00aa`, `#f0a`, `ff00aa`, `f0a`\r* **RGB Color** -- This is an RGB color in the format `rgb(1.0,1.0,1.0)` or `rgb(256,256,256)`. Decimal numbers are in the scale of 0.0 to 1.0, integer numbers are scaled 0 to 256. Note that numbers can be outside this range for the purpose of doing math.\r* **HSV Color** -- This is an HSV color in the format `hsv(1.0,1.0,1.0)` or `hsv(360,100,100)`. Decimal numbers are in the scale of 0.0 to 1.0, integer numbers are scaled 0 to 360 for the hue and 0 to 100 for saturation and value.

        "description": "# It's A Trap!\r\r_v3.13 Updates_\r\r* Can specify 'none' for trap trigger areas.\r* Can specify message for when a character notices a trap via passive detection using the 'Detection Message' property.\r\rThis is a script that allows GMs to quickly and very easily set up traps,\rsecret doors, and other hidden things on the GM layer, and detect when tokens\ron the objects layer move over them. This trap detection even works for tokens\rmoving by waypoints.\r\rCombined with modules called Trap Themes, this script also allows system-specific\rautomation of trap effects and passive perception used to spot them.\r\r## Trap Maker menu\rWhen this script is installed, it installs a macro called **TrapMaker**. When you\rselect a token that you want to set up as a trap and click this macro, it\rdisplays a **Trap Configuration** menu in the VTT's chat, from which you can\rmodify the trap's various properties (discussed below).\r\rWhen you use this menu on a token for the first time, it will be moved\rto the **GM layer** and it will be given the **cobweb** status marker. The script\ruses these properties to identify which tokens are active as traps.\r\rThe GM notes section of the trap's token will be used to hold the JSON data for\rthe trap's properties. Please do not edit the GM notes for a trap token\rmanually.\r\r### Enabling the menu macro\rThis macro is not added to your macro bar automatically, so you'll need to\rcheck the **In Bar** checkbox next to the **TrapMaker** macro to activate it.\r\r## Trap properties\rThe following subsections go into detail about each of the properties that can\rbe set and modified for a trap.\r\r### Core properties\rThese are the basic properties of the trap.\r\r#### Name\rThis is the name of the trap.\r\re.g. _'pit trap'_ or _'explosive runes'_\r\r#### Type\rThe It's A Trap! script, contrary to its name, can be used to automate more kinds of\rhidden objects than just traps. By default, the value of this property will just be\r_'trap'_, but you could define it to be something like _'hazard'_, _'hidden enemy'_,\ror _'concealed item'_ instead. This type will appear in the trap's header when\rit is activated.\r\rE.g., the header will read 'IT'S A TRAP!!!' if the type is 'trap', or\r'IT'S A HAZARD!!!' if the type is 'hazard'\r\rThis property otherwise has no mechanical effect.\r\r#### Message\rThis message will be displayed when the trap is activated.\r\re.g. _'You feel a floor sink under your feet as you step on a hidden pressure plate. Behind you, you hear the violent grinding of stone against stone, getting closer. A massive rolling boulder is heading this way!'_\r\r#### Disabled?\rThis sets whether the trap is currently disabled or not. A trap that is disabled\rcannot be triggered.\r\r#### Show GM Only\rThis sets whether the trap's activation will only be shared with the GM. If this\ris set to **yes**, the trap's GM Notes and its theme-based results will be\rshared only with the GM. Visible effects of a trap, such as the its message,\rsound, Areas of Effect, etc. will be ignored, and the trap will not be revealed.\r\rThis property is best used for traps, hazards, and alarms whose effects will\rnot be readily apparent when they are activated.\r\re.g. This could be set to 'yes' for a tripwire that alerts monsters in\ranother room to the party's presence.\r\r#### Secret Notes\rThese notes are whispered to the GM when the trap is activated. These notes won't be shown to any of the other players.\r\re.g. _'The tripwire sets off a silent alarm, alerting the mindflayers in the laboratory room to the party's presence.'_\r\r### Trigger properties\rThese properties all have to do with how the trap is triggered.\r\r#### Trigger Area\rThis defines the area that a character must move through in order to trigger the\rtrap. Options include:\r\r* **self - rectangle**: The trap's own token is used as the trigger area, which is treated as a rectangular shape.\r* **self - circle**: The trap's own token is used as the trigger area, which is treated as a circular shape.\r* **set selected lines**: You must have one or more lines selected on the VTT to use this option. Those lines will be used as the trigger area for the trap.\r* **none**: The trap has no trigger area, thus it cannot be triggered. Use this for things like secret doors, which shouldn't activate, but should be noticeable with passive detection.\r\r#### Trigger Collision\rThis property defines how character tokens collide with the trap's trigger area. Options include:\r\r* **center**: When a character crosses the trap's trigger area, they are moved to the trap token's center. This option only works for traps whose trigger area is *self*.\r* **edge**: When a character crosses the trap's trigger area, their movement is stopped at the trigger area's edge.\r* **none**: Character tokens are not stopped when they move through the trap's trigger area.\r\rThis property is ignored if the Delay Activation property is set.\r\r#### Ignore Token IDs\rThis property is used to select one or more creature tokens that will not be affected by a trap. Neither can these tokens trigger the trap.\r\r* **none**: No ignored tokens.\r* **set selected tokens**: To use this option, you must have one or more tokens selected. These tokens will be ignored by the trap.\r\r#### Affects Flying Tokens\rBy default, traps will only affect tokens that are not flying. Tokens are treated as 'flying' by this script if they have the **fluffy wing** status marker active.\r\rIf this property is set to **yes**, it will affect all tokens, regardless of whether\ror not they have the **fluffy wing** status marker active.\r\rLeave this set to **no** for floor-based traps. For traps that affect creatures on\rthe ground and in the air alike, set this to **yes**.\r\r#### Delay Activation\rThis property sets a delay, in **seconds**, between when the trap is triggered to\rwhen it actually activates.\r\rAs a side-effect, the trap's trigger will be deactivated once this delay is\ractivated. This is to prevent the delayed trap from triggering multiple times.\r\r### Activation properties\rThese properties all have to do with what happens when the trap activates.\r\r#### Activation Area\rThis defines the area in which characters can be affected by the trap when it activates. Options include:\r\r* **self**: The trap's token is used as the activation area.\r* **burst**: The trap affects all characters within a certain radius of it.\r* **set selected shapes**: To use this option, you must have one or more filled shapes selected. The trap affects all characters inside those shapes.\r\r#### Burst Radius\rThis property is only visible if **Activation Area** is set to **burst**. This\rsets the radius of the burst area.\r\r#### Special FX\rThis property is used to display a particle effect when the trap activates,\rusing Roll20's special FX system.\r\rThe first prompt asks for the name of the effect that will be displayed. This can\reither be the name of a custom special effect you've created, or it can be the\rname of a built in effect. Built-in special effects follow the naming convention\r**effect-color**. e.g. _explode-fire_ or _beam-acid_\r\rSee https://wiki.roll20.net/Custom_FX#Built-in_Effects for more\rinformation on supported built-in effect and color names.\r\rThe second prompt allows you to specify an offset of the effect's origin point,\rin the format **[X,Y]**. The X,Y offset, relative to the trap's token is measured\rin squares. If this is omitted, the trap's token will be used as the effect's\rorigin point.\re.g. _[3,4]_\r\rThe third prompt allows you to specify a vector for the direction of the effect,\rin the format **[X,Y]**, with each vector component measured in squares. If this\ris omitted, the effect will be directed towards the victims' tokens.\re.g. _[0,-1]_\r\r#### Sound\rThis property sets a sound from your jukebox to be played when the trap is activated.\r\r#### Chained Trap IDs\rThis property allows you to set other traps to activate when this one does. Options include:\r\r* **none**: No other traps are activated by this trap.\r* **set selected traps**: You must have one or more other trap tokens selected to use this option. When this trap activates, the selected traps will activate too.\r\r#### Delete after Activation?\rIf this property is set to **yes**, then the trap's token will be deleted after it is activated.\r\r### Detection properties\r\r#### Max Search Distance\rThis property defines the distance at which a character can attempt to notice a\rtrap passively. If this is not set, the search distance is assumed to be infinite.\r\rDynamic lighting walls will block line of sight to a trap, even if the character\ris close enough to otherwise try to passively spot it.\r\re.g. If this is set to 10 ft, then a character must be within 10 ft of the trap in order to passively notice it.\r\r#### Detection Message\r\rBy default, when a character notices a trap via passive detection (Perception/Spot/etc.),\rthe script will just announce the name of the trap that was noticed. Use this property to specify\ra custom message to be displayed when a character notices a trap.\r\re.g. 'The air feels warm and you notice holes greased with oil lining the walls.'\r\r#### Reveal the Trap?\rThis property determines whether the trap's token will be revealed (moved to a visible layer) when it is activated and/or detected.\r\rThe first prompt asks if the trap should be revealed when it is activated (yes or no).\r\rThe second prompt asks if the trap should be revealed when it is detected (yes or no).\r\rThe third prompt asks which layer the trap token is moved to when it is detected (Just click OK or press enter if you chose **no** for both of the earlier prompts).\r\r### External script properties\rThese properties are available when you have certain other API scripts installed.\r\r#### API Command\rThis property can be used to issue an API chat command when the trap activates.\rThis property supports a couple keywords to support commands involving the trap\rand its victims.\r\rThe keyword TRAP_ID will be substituted for the ID of the trap's token.\r\rThe keyword VICTIM_ID will be substituted for the ID of token for some character\rbeing affected by the trap. If there are multiple victims affected by the trap,\rthe command will be issued individually for each victim.\r\rThe keyword VICTIM_CHAR_ID will be substituted for the ID of the character being\raffected by the trap.\r\re.g. _'!someApiCommand TRAP_ID VICTIM_ID VICTIM_CHAR_NAME'_\r\rFor some API commands using special characters, you'll need to escape those\rcharacters by prefixing them with a \\ (backslash). These special characters\rinclude: [, ], {, }, and @.\r\r#### Areas of Effect script\rThis property is only available if you have the **Areas of Effect** script installed.\rIt also requires you to have at least one effect saved in that script.\rThis allows you to have the trap spawn an area of effect graphic when it is triggered.\r\rThe first prompt will ask you to choose an area of effect chosen from\rthose saved in the Areas of Effect script.\r\rThe second prompt will ask for a vector in the form **[dx,dy]**, indicating the\rdirection of the effect. Each component of this vector is measured in squares.\rIf this vector is omitted, the effect will be directed towards the victims' tokens.\r\r#### KABOOM script\rThis property is only available if you have the **KABOOM** script\r(by Bodin Punyaprateep (PaprikaCC)) installed. This allows you to create a\rKABOOM effect centered on the trap's token. This can be handy for pushing tokens\rback due to an explosive trap!\r\rThe prompts for the property are used to define the properties for the KABOOM effect,\ras defined in the KABOOM script's documentation.\r\r#### TokenMod script\rThis property is only available if you have the **TokenMod** script (by The Aaron)\rinstalled. This allows you to set properties on tokens affected by the trap, using\rthe API command parameters described in the TokenMod script's documentation.\r\re.g. _'--set statusmarkers|broken-shield'_\r\r## Trap Themes:\rTrap themes are special side-scripts used to provide support for formatting messages for traps and\rautomating system-specific trap activation and passive search mechanics.\r\rBy default the **default** theme will be used. This is a very basic,\rsystem-agnostic theme and has no special properties.\r\rIf you install a system-specific trap theme, It's A Trap will automatically\rdetect and use that theme instead. Additional system-specific themes are\ravailable as their own API scripts.\r\r### Theme-specific properties\rTrap themes come with new properties that are added to the Trap Maker menu.\rThis includes things such as modifiers for the trap's attacks, the trap's\rdamage, and the dice rolls needed to passively detect the trap.\r\rDocumentation for these properties are provided in the script documentation for\rthe respective trap theme.\r\r## Activating traps:\rIf a character token moves across a trap's trigger area at ANY point during its\rmovement, the trap will be activated! Traps are only active while they are\ron the GM layer. Moving it to another layer will disable it.\r\rA trap can also be manually activated by clicking the 'Activate Trap' button\rin the trap's configuration menu.\r\r## Help\r\rMy scripts are provided 'as-is', without warranty of any kind, expressed or implied.\r\rThat said, if you experience any issues while using this script,\rneed help using it, or if you have a neat suggestion for a new feature,\rplease shoot me a PM:\rhttps://app.roll20.net/users/46544/ada-l\r\rWhen messaging me about an issue, please be sure to include any error messages that\rappear in your API Console Log, any configurations you've got set up for the\rscript in the VTT, and any options you've got set up for the script on your\rgame's API Scripts page. The more information you provide me, the better the\rchances I'll be able to help.\r\r## Show Support\r\rIf you would like to show your appreciation and support for the work I do in writing,\rupdating, maintaining, and providing tech support my API scripts,\rplease consider buying one of my art packs from the Roll20 marketplace:\r\rhttps://marketplace.roll20.net/browse/publisher/165/ada-lindberg\r",

This trap detection even works for tokens<br/>\nmoving by waypoints.</p>\n\n<p>Combined with modules called Trap Themes, this script also allows system-specific<br/>\nautomation of trap effects and passive perception used to spot them.</p>\n\n<h2>Trap Maker menu</h2>\n\n<p>When this script is installed, it installs a macro called <strong>TrapMaker</strong>. When you<br/>\nselect a token that you want to set up as a trap and click this macro, it<br/>\ndisplays a <strong>Trap Configuration</strong> menu in the VTT&#39;s chat, from which you can<br/>\nmodify the trap&#39;s various properties (discussed below).</p>\n\n<p>When you use this menu on a token for the first time, it will be moved<br/>\nto the <strong>GM layer</strong> and it will be given the <strong>cobweb</strong> status marker. The script<br/>\nuses these properties to identify which tokens are active as traps.</p>\n\n<p>The GM notes section of the trap&#39;s token will be used to hold the JSON data for<br/>\nthe trap&#39;s properties. Please do not edit the GM notes for a trap token<br/>\nmanually.</p>\n\n<h3>Enabling the menu macro</h3>\n\n<p>This macro is not added to your macro bar automatically, so you&#39;ll need to<br/>\ncheck the <strong>In Bar</strong> checkbox next to the <strong>TrapMaker</strong> macro to activate it.</p>\n\n<h2>Trap properties</h2>\n\n<p>The following subsections go into detail about each of the properties that can<br/>\nbe set and modified for a trap.</p>\n\n<h3>Core properties</h3>\n\n<p>These are the basic properties of the trap.</p>\n\n<h4>Name</h4>\n\n<p>This is the name of the trap.</p>\n\n<p>e.g. <em>&#39;pit trap&#39;</em> or <em>&#39;explosive runes&#39;</em></p>\n\n<h4>Type</h4>\n\n<p>The It&#39;s A Trap! script, contrary to its name, can be used to automate more kinds of<br/>\nhidden objects than just traps. By default, the value of this property will just be<br/>\n<em>&#39;trap&#39;</em>, but you could define it to be something like <em>&#39;hazard&#39;</em>, <em>&#39;hidden enemy&#39;</em>,<br/>\nor <em>&#39;concealed item&#39;</em> instead. This type will appear in the trap&#39;s header when<br/>\nit is activated.</p>\n\n<p>E.g., the header will read &#39;IT&#39;S A TRAP!!!&#39; if the type is &#39;trap&#39;, or<br/>\n&#39;IT&#39;S A HAZARD!!!&#39; if the type is &#39;hazard&#39;</p>\n\n<p>This property otherwise has no mechanical effect.</p>\n\n<h4>Message</h4>\n\n<p>This message will be displayed when the trap is activated.</p>\n\n<p>e.g. <em>&#39;You feel a floor sink under your feet as you step on a hidden pressure plate. Behind you, you hear the violent grinding of stone against stone, getting closer. A massive rolling boulder is heading this way!&#39;</em></p>\n\n<h4>Disabled?</h4>\n\n<p>This sets whether the trap is currently disabled or not. A trap that is disabled<br/>\ncannot be triggered.</p>\n\n<h4>Show GM Only</h4>\n\n<p>This sets whether the trap&#39;s activation will only be shared with the GM. If this<br/>\nis set to <strong>yes</strong>, the trap&#39;s GM Notes and its theme-based results will be<br/>\nshared only with the GM. Visible effects of a trap, such as the its message,<br/>\nsound, Areas of Effect, etc. will be ignored, and the trap will not be revealed.</p>\n\n<p>This property is best used for traps, hazards, and alarms whose effects will<br/>\nnot be readily apparent when they are activated.</p>\n\n<p>e.g. This could be set to &#39;yes&#39; for a tripwire that alerts monsters in<br/>\nanother room to the party&#39;s presence.</p>\n\n<h4>Secret Notes</h4>\n\n<p>These notes are whispered to the GM when the trap is activated. These notes won&#39;t be shown to any of the other players.</p>\n\n<p>e.g. <em>&#39;The tripwire sets off a silent alarm, alerting the mindflayers in the laboratory room to the party&#39;s presence.&#39;</em></p>\n\n<h3>Trigger properties</h3>\n\n<p>These properties all have to do with how the trap is triggered.</p>\n\n<h4>Trigger Area</h4>\n\n<p>This defines the area that a character must move through in order to trigger the<br/>\ntrap. Options include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>self - rectangle</strong>: The trap&#39;s own token is used as the trigger area, which is treated as a rectangular shape.</li>\n<li><strong>self - circle</strong>: The trap&#39;s own token is used as the trigger area, which is treated as a circular shape.</li>\n<li><strong>set selected lines</strong>: You must have one or more lines selected on the VTT to use this option. Those lines will be used as the trigger area for the trap.</li>\n<li><strong>none</strong>: The trap has no trigger area, thus it cannot be triggered. Use this for things like secret doors, which shouldn&#39;t activate, but should be noticeable with passive detection.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Trigger Collision</h4>\n\n<p>This property defines how character tokens collide with the trap&#39;s trigger area. Options include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>center</strong>: When a character crosses the trap&#39;s trigger area, they are moved to the trap token&#39;s center. This option only works for traps whose trigger area is <em>self</em>.</li>\n<li><strong>edge</strong>: When a character crosses the trap&#39;s trigger area, their movement is stopped at the trigger area&#39;s edge.</li>\n<li><strong>none</strong>: Character tokens are not stopped when they move through the trap&#39;s trigger area.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This property is ignored if the Delay Activation property is set.</p>\n\n<h4>Ignore Token IDs</h4>\n\n<p>This property is used to select one or more creature tokens that will not be affected by a trap. Neither can these tokens trigger the trap.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>none</strong>: No ignored tokens.</li>\n<li><strong>set selected tokens</strong>: To use this option, you must have one or more tokens selected. These tokens will be ignored by the trap.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Affects Flying Tokens</h4>\n\n<p>By default, traps will only affect tokens that are not flying. Tokens are treated as &#39;flying&#39; by this script if they have the <strong>fluffy wing</strong> status marker active.</p>\n\n<p>If this property is set to <strong>yes</strong>, it will affect all tokens, regardless of whether<br/>\nor not they have the <strong>fluffy wing</strong> status marker active.</p>\n\n<p>Leave this set to <strong>no</strong> for floor-based traps. For traps that affect creatures on<br/>\nthe ground and in the air alike, set this to <strong>yes</strong>.</p>\n\n<h4>Delay Activation</h4>\n\n<p>This property sets a delay, in <strong>seconds</strong>, between when the trap is triggered to<br/>\nwhen it actually activates.</p>\n\n<p>As a side-effect, the trap&#39;s trigger will be deactivated once this delay is<br/>\nactivated. This is to prevent the delayed trap from triggering multiple times.</p>\n\n<h3>Activation properties</h3>\n\n<p>These properties all have to do with what happens when the trap activates.</p>\n\n<h4>Activation Area</h4>\n\n<p>This defines the area in which characters can be affected by the trap when it activates. Options include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>self</strong>: The trap&#39;s token is used as the activation area.</li>\n<li><strong>burst</strong>: The trap affects all characters within a certain radius of it.</li>\n<li><strong>set selected shapes</strong>: To use this option, you must have one or more filled shapes selected. The trap affects all characters inside those shapes.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Burst Radius</h4>\n\n<p>This property is only visible if <strong>Activation Area</strong> is set to <strong>burst</strong>. This<br/>\nsets the radius of the burst area.</p>\n\n<h4>Special FX</h4>\n\n<p>This property is used to display a particle effect when the trap activates,<br/>\nusing Roll20&#39;s special FX system.</p>\n\n<p>The first prompt asks for the name of the effect that will be displayed. This can<br/>\neither be the name of a custom special effect you&#39;ve created, or it can be the<br/>\nname of a built in effect. Built-in special effects follow the naming convention<br/>\n<strong>effect-color</strong>. e.g. <em>explode-fire</em> or <em>beam-acid</em></p>\n\n<p>See <a href=\"https://wiki.roll20.net/Custom_FX#Built-in_Effects\">https://wiki.roll20.net/Custom_FX#Built-in_Effects</a> for more<br/>\ninformation on supported built-in effect and color names.</p>\n\n<p>The second prompt allows you to specify an offset of the effect&#39;s origin point,<br/>\nin the format <strong>[X,Y]</strong>. The X,Y offset, relative to the trap&#39;s token is measured<br/>\nin squares. If this is omitted, the trap&#39;s token will be used as the effect&#39;s<br/>\norigin point.<br/>\ne.g. <em>[3,4]</em></p>\n\n<p>The third prompt allows you to specify a vector for the direction of the effect,<br/>\nin the format <strong>[X,Y]</strong>, with each vector component measured in squares. If this<br/>\nis omitted, the effect will be directed towards the victims&#39; tokens.<br/>\ne.g. <em>[0,-1]</em></p>\n\n<h4>Sound</h4>\n\n<p>This property sets a sound from your jukebox to be played when the trap is activated.</p>\n\n<h4>Chained Trap IDs</h4>\n\n<p>This property allows you to set other traps to activate when this one does. Options include:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>none</strong>: No other traps are activated by this trap.</li>\n<li><strong>set selected traps</strong>: You must have one or more other trap tokens selected to use this option. When this trap activates, the selected traps will activate too.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Delete after Activation?</h4>\n\n<p>If this property is set to <strong>yes</strong>, then the trap&#39;s token will be deleted after it is activated.</p>\n\n<h3>Detection properties</h3>\n\n<h4>Max Search Distance</h4>\n\n<p>This property defines the distance at which a character can attempt to notice a<br/>\ntrap passively. If this is not set, the search distance is assumed to be infinite.</p>\n\n<p>Dynamic lighting walls will block line of sight to a trap, even if the character<br/>\nis close enough to otherwise try to passively spot it.</p>\n\n<p>e.g. If this is set to 10 ft, then a character must be within 10 ft of the trap in order to passively notice it.</p>\n\n<h4>Detection Message</h4>\n\n<p>By default, when a character notices a trap via passive detection (Perception/Spot/etc.),<br/>\nthe script will just announce the name of the trap that was noticed. Use this property to specify<br/>\na custom message to be displayed when a character notices a trap.</p>\n\n<p>e.g. &#39;The air feels warm and you notice holes greased with oil lining the walls.&#39;</p>\n\n<h4>Reveal the Trap?</h4>\n\n<p>This property determines whether the trap&#39;s token will be revealed (moved to a visible layer) when it is activated and/or detected.</p>\n\n<p>The first prompt asks if the trap should be revealed when it is activated (yes or no).</p>\n\n<p>The second prompt asks if the trap should be revealed when it is detected (yes or no).</p>\n\n<p>The third prompt asks which layer the trap token is moved to when it is detected (Just click OK or press enter if you chose <strong>no</strong> for both of the earlier prompts).</p>\n\n<h3>External script properties</h3>\n\n<p>These properties are available when you have certain other API scripts installed.</p>\n\n<h4>API Command</h4>\n\n<p>This property can be used to issue an API chat command when the trap activates.<br/>\nThis property supports a couple keywords to support commands involving the trap<br/>\nand its victims.</p>\n\n<p>The keyword TRAP_ID will be substituted for the ID of the trap&#39;s token.</p>\n\n<p>The keyword VICTIM_ID will be substituted for the ID of token for some character<br/>\nbeing affected by the trap. If there are multiple victims affected by the trap,<br/>\nthe command will be issued individually for each victim.</p>\n\n<p>The keyword VICTIM<em>CHAR</em>ID will be substituted for the ID of the character being<br/>\naffected by the trap.</p>\n\n<p>e.g. <em>&#39;!someApiCommand TRAP</em>ID VICTIM<em>ID VICTIM</em>CHAR<em>NAME&#39;</em></p>\n\n<p>For some API commands using special characters, you&#39;ll need to escape those<br/>\ncharacters by prefixing them with a \\ (backslash). These special characters<br/>\ninclude: [, ], {, }, and @.</p>\n\n<h4>Areas of Effect script</h4>\n\n<p>This property is only available if you have the <strong>Areas of Effect</strong> script installed.<br/>\nIt also requires you to have at least one effect saved in that script.<br/>\nThis allows you to have the trap spawn an area of effect graphic when it is triggered.</p>\n\n<p>The first prompt will ask you to choose an area of effect chosen from<br/>\nthose saved in the Areas of Effect script.</p>\n\n<p>The second prompt will ask for a vector in the form <strong>[dx,dy]</strong>, indicating the<br/>\ndirection of the effect. Each component of this vector is measured in squares.<br/>\nIf this vector is omitted, the effect will be directed towards the victims&#39; tokens.</p>\n\n<h4>KABOOM script</h4>\n\n<p>This property is only available if you have the <strong>KABOOM</strong> script<br/>\n(by Bodin Punyaprateep (PaprikaCC)) installed. This allows you to create a<br/>\nKABOOM effect centered on the trap&#39;s token. This can be handy for pushing tokens<br/>\nback due to an explosive trap!</p>\n\n<p>The prompts for the property are used to define the properties for the KABOOM effect,<br/>\nas defined in the KABOOM script&#39;s documentation.</p>\n\n<h4>TokenMod script</h4>\n\n<p>This property is only available if you have the <strong>TokenMod</strong> script (by The Aaron)<br/>\ninstalled. This allows you to set properties on tokens affected by the trap, using<br/>\nthe API command parameters described in the TokenMod script&#39;s documentation.</p>\n\n<p>e.g. <em>&#39;--set statusmarkers|broken-shield&#39;</em></p>\n\n<h2>Trap Themes:</h2>\n\n<p>Trap themes are special side-scripts used to provide support for formatting messages for traps and<br/>\nautomating system-specific trap activation and passive search mechanics.</p>\n\n<p>By default the <strong>default</strong> theme will be used. This is a very basic,<br/>\nsystem-agnostic theme and has no special properties.</p>\n\n<p>If you install a system-specific trap theme, It&#39;s A Trap will automatically<br/>\ndetect and use that theme instead. Additional system-specific themes are<br/>\navailable as their own API scripts.</p>\n\n<h3>Theme-specific properties</h3>\n\n<p>Trap themes come with new properties that are added to the Trap Maker menu.<br/>\nThis includes things such as modifiers for the trap&#39;s attacks, the trap&#39;s<br/>\ndamage, and the dice rolls needed to passively detect the trap.</p>\n\n<p>Documentation for these properties are provided in the script documentation for<br/>\nthe respective trap theme.</p>\n\n<h2>Activating traps:</h2>\n\n<p>If a character token moves across a trap&#39;s trigger area at ANY point during its<br/>\nmovement, the trap will be activated! Traps are only active while they are<br/>\non the GM layer. Moving it to another layer will disable it.</p>\n\n<p>A trap can also be manually activated by clicking the &#39;Activate Trap&#39; button<br/>\nin the trap&#39;s configuration menu.</p>\n\n<h2>Help</h2>\n\n<p>My scripts are provided &#39;as-is&#39;, without warranty of any kind, expressed or implied.</p>\n\n<p>That said, if you experience any issues while using this script,<br/>\nneed help using it, or if you have a neat suggestion for a new feature,<br/>\nplease shoot me a PM:<br/>\n<a href=\"https://app.roll20.net/users/46544/ada-l\">https://app.roll20.net/users/46544/ada-l</a></p>\n\n<p>When messaging me about an issue, please be sure to include any error messages that<br/>\nappear in your API Console Log, any configurations you&#39;ve got set up for the<br/>\nscript in the VTT, and any options you&#39;ve got set up for the script on your<br/>\ngame&#39;s API Scripts page.

        "description": "# KABOOM.js\r\rEver wonder why the tokens inside of your flimsy straw houses never budge when\ryour players decide that fireball is the easiest solution to their troubles? It\rmight have to do with the copious amounts of Sovereign Glue you keep around, but\rfor everything else there is KABOOM!\r\r## What can you use KABOOM for?\r* Creating explosions that force tokens to move away\r* Creating whirlpools that drag things towards their centers\r* Creating explosions that suck things towards themselves?\r* Creating whirlpools that spit things out?\r* **Any area of effect that requires tokens to move a towards or away from a point**\r\r## How do I use it?\rYou can call KABOOM through chat with a simple message, or you can use it with\rother scripts by calling KABOOM.NOW(@param1, @param2)\r\r### Using KABOOM - Chat Commands:\rThe basic chat command follows this format:\r`!KABOOM effect-power [ effect-radius [ options [ --default-options]]]`\r`!KABOOM -15 50 no scatter --blood`\r\rWhen you use KABOOM as a chat command, you need to have a token selected.\rONLY effect-power is required. Everything else is optional.\r\r**effect-power** is the strength of the force moving tokens away or towards from\r                the explosion point. It is measured in the same units listed on\r                the page. Effect-power can be negative if you want to pull things\r                towards the object instead of pushing away.\r\r**effect-radius** is the maximum distance that the script search for objects to\r                manipulate. If something is beyond this point, it will not move.\r                Defaults to **effect-power * explosion_ratio**. This is always\r                parsed as positive.\r\r**options** are either 'vfx', 'no vfx', 'no-vfx', 'invisible', 'invis' to change\r            whether an explosion effect appears, or 'scatter' and 'no scatter'\r            if you want to scatter tokens away from the explosion/implosion point\r            more randomly.\r\r**--default-options** can be found in the help menu, which is reached by typing\r                    `!KABOOM` or `!KABOOM --help` into chat.\r\r### Using KABOOM - API calls:\rThe simplest function call looks something like this:\r`KABOOM.NOW(15, [500,300])`\r\rSomething more complicated may look like this:\r```\ron('change:token', function(obj) {\r    if (obj.id === bigBaddie.id) {\r        KABOOM.NOW({effectPower: 5, effectRadius: 15, type: 'death'}, obj)\r    }\r}\r```\r\r## API calls to KABOOM.NOW()\r\r@param1 accepts two formats:\r\r1. __An object that contains the ranges and type information about the explosion__\r2. __A number that will be used as the effect power__\r\r```\r@param1 = {\r    effectPower: <any number>               // Required at all times\r    effectRadius: <any positive number>     // Must be absolutely higher than effectPower\r    type: <any Roll20 VFX type>\r    vfx: <true or false>\r    scatter: <true or false>\r}\r```\r\r@param2 accepts three formats:\r\r1. __A Roll20 graphic object received from getObj()__\r2. __A coordinate array which will be used to determine the position of the explosion__\r3. __An object that contains a position property with an array as its value__\r\r```\r@param2 = {\r    position: [X_coordinate, Y_coordinate]  // Required at all times\r    pageid: <a valid pageid>\r    layer: <objects or map>\r}\r```\r\r\r# KABOOM options\rThe following is a list of all stored settings that KABOOM uses. You can change these through chat commands\rin the\r\r### --vfx\rThis option determines if a Roll20 VFX effect will be created at the center of the effect.\rIt's mostly cool and you can choose to turn this off to make invisible explosions.\r\r### --ignore-size\rBy default, the script values object sizes when determining if they should be moved.\rIf this is false, then weight will not be considered when calculating distances thrown.\rMake sure that same-layer-only is true if this is false, or you may move your background tiles.\r\r### --default-type\rThis option determines the colour of the VFX explosion if none is specified. The colours available are:\r'acid', 'blood', 'charm', 'death', 'fire', 'frost', 'holy', 'magic', 'slime', 'smoke', and 'water'\r\r### --same-layer-only\rBy default, this script does not affect objects on other layers. If this is false\rthen KABOOM will move graphics on all layers. Make sure that your background graphics\rare larger than the max-size if this is false and that ignore-size is not true.\r\r### --min-size\rThe value stored as min-size determines the size that objects must be if they\rwant to move the maximum distance (barring their distance from the explosion center).\rIt is measured in sq. units.\r\r### --max-size\rThe value stored as max-size determines the maximum size that objects may be\rbefore they are considered too heavy to move. It is measured in sq. units.\r\r### --scattering\rThis option increases the randomness of movement done by the script. If this is\roff, then KABOOM will always throw two objects in the same spot towards the same\rlocation. If this is on, then it is randomized slightly.\r\r### --default-layer\rThis determines the default layer that KABOOM will affect if you are using it\rin another script. This option only affects calls of KABOOM.NOW() that do not\rgive the script a layer to use.\r\r### --drawings-only\rIf this is on, then the script will only search for drawings to manipulate and\rwill ignore all other tokens.\r\r### --walls\rTurn walls on to force the script to obey walls on the dynamic lighting layer.\rIf it is off, then walls will be ignored when calculating distances thrown.\r\r\r# Globalconfig options\rThese options can only be changed through the Script library panel at the API page.\r\r### GM only\rThis setting changes whether you want to restrict the use of this command to GMs only or allow\raccess to players as well. KABOOM will still require that players select a token before using the\rcommand, but this may be changed in the future to accept @{target1|token_id} macros.\r\r### Explosion ratio\rThis ratio determines what the area of effect for KABOOM explosions will be if one is\rnot specified. By default, the script multiplies the effect power by this number to\ruse as the effect radius. It is suggested to keep close to 2, but we won't complain\rif you go crazy.",

It<br/>\nmight have to do with the copious amounts of Sovereign Glue you keep around, but<br/>\nfor everything else there is KABOOM!</p>\n\n<h2>What can you use KABOOM for?</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Creating explosions that force tokens to move away</li>\n<li>Creating whirlpools that drag things towards their centers</li>\n<li>Creating explosions that suck things towards themselves?</li>\n<li>Creating whirlpools that spit things out?</li>\n<li><strong>Any area of effect that requires tokens to move a towards or away from a point</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>How do I use it?</h2>\n\n<p>You can call KABOOM through chat with a simple message, or you can use it with<br/>\nother scripts by calling KABOOM.NOW(@param1, @param2)</p>\n\n<h3>Using KABOOM - Chat Commands:</h3>\n\n<p>The basic chat command follows this format:<br/>\n<code>!KABOOM effect-power [ effect-radius [ options [ --default-options]]]</code><br/>\n<code>!KABOOM -15 50 no scatter --blood</code></p>\n\n<p>When you use KABOOM as a chat command, you need to have a token selected.<br/>\nONLY effect-power is required. Everything else is optional.</p>\n\n<p><strong>effect-power</strong> is the strength of the force moving tokens away or towards from<br/>\n                the explosion point. It is measured in the same units listed on<br/>\n                the page. Effect-power can be negative if you want to pull things<br/>\n                towards the object instead of pushing away.</p>\n\n<p><strong>effect-radius</strong> is the maximum distance that the script search for objects to<br/>\n                manipulate. If something is beyond this point, it will not move.<br/>\n                Defaults to <strong>effect-power * explosion_ratio</strong>. This is always<br/>\n                parsed as positive.</p>\n\n<p><strong>options</strong> are either &#39;vfx&#39;, &#39;no vfx&#39;, &#39;no-vfx&#39;, &#39;invisible&#39;, &#39;invis&#39; to change<br/>\n            whether an explosion effect appears, or &#39;scatter&#39; and &#39;no scatter&#39;<br/>\n            if you want to scatter tokens away from the explosion/implosion point<br/>\n            more randomly.</p>\n\n<p><strong>--default-options</strong> can be found in the help menu, which is reached by typing<br/>\n                    <code>!KABOOM</code> or <code>!KABOOM --help</code> into chat.</p>\n\n<h3>Using KABOOM - API calls:</h3>\n\n<p>The simplest function call looks something like this:<br/>\n<code>KABOOM.NOW(15, [500,300])</code></p>\n\n<p>Something more complicated may look like this:<br/>\n<code><br/>\non(&#39;change:token&#39;, function(obj) {<br/>\n    if (obj.id === bigBaddie.id) {<br/>\n        KABOOM.NOW({effectPower: 5, effectRadius: 15, type: &#39;death&#39;}, obj)<br/>\n    }<br/>\n}<br/>\n</code></p>\n\n<h2>API calls to KABOOM.NOW()</h2>\n\n<p>@param1 accepts two formats:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>An object that contains the ranges and type information about the explosion</strong></li>\n<li><strong>A number that will be used as the effect power</strong></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><code><br/>\n@param1 = {<br/>\n    effectPower: &lt;any number&gt;               // Required at all times<br/>\n    effectRadius: &lt;any positive number&gt;     // Must be absolutely higher than effectPower<br/>\n    type: &lt;any Roll20 VFX type&gt;<br/>\n    vfx: &lt;true or false&gt;<br/>\n    scatter: &lt;true or false&gt;<br/>\n}<br/>\n</code></p>\n\n<p>@param2 accepts three formats:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><strong>A Roll20 graphic object received from getObj()</strong></li>\n<li><strong>A coordinate array which will be used to determine the position of the explosion</strong></li>\n<li><strong>An object that contains a position property with an array as its value</strong></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><code><br/>\n@param2 = {<br/>\n    position: [X_coordinate, Y_coordinate]  // Required at all times<br/>\n    pageid: &lt;a valid pageid&gt;<br/>\n    layer: &lt;objects or map&gt;<br/>\n}<br/>\n</code></p>\n\n<h1>KABOOM options</h1>\n\n<p>The following is a list of all stored settings that KABOOM uses. You can change these through chat commands<br/>\nin the</p>\n\n<h3>--vfx</h3>\n\n<p>This option determines if a Roll20 VFX effect will be created at the center of the effect.<br/>\nIt&#39;s mostly cool and you can choose to turn this off to make invisible explosions.</p>\n\n<h3>--ignore-size</h3>\n\n<p>By default, the script values object sizes when determining if they should be moved.<br/>\nIf this is false, then weight will not be considered when calculating distances thrown.<br/>\nMake sure that same-layer-only is true if this is false, or you may move your background tiles.</p>\n\n<h3>--default-type</h3>\n\n<p>This option determines the colour of the VFX explosion if none is specified. The colours available are:<br/>\n&#39;acid&#39;, &#39;blood&#39;, &#39;charm&#39;, &#39;death&#39;, &#39;fire&#39;, &#39;frost&#39;, &#39;holy&#39;, &#39;magic&#39;, &#39;slime&#39;, &#39;smoke&#39;, and &#39;water&#39;</p>\n\n<h3>--same-layer-only</h3>\n\n<p>By default, this script does not affect objects on other layers. If this is false<br/>\nthen KABOOM will move graphics on all layers. Make sure that your background graphics<br/>\nare larger than the max-size if this is false and that ignore-size is not true.</p>\n\n<h3>--min-size</h3>\n\n<p>The value stored as min-size determines the size that objects must be if they<br/>\nwant to move the maximum distance (barring their distance from the explosion center).<br/>\nIt is measured in sq. units.</p>\n\n<h3>--max-size</h3>\n\n<p>The value stored as max-size determines the maximum size that objects may be<br/>\nbefore they are considered too heavy to move. It is measured in sq. units.</p>\n\n<h3>--scattering</h3>\n\n<p>This option increases the randomness of movement done by the script. If this is<br/>\noff, then KABOOM will always throw two objects in the same spot towards the same<br/>\nlocation. If this is on, then it is randomized slightly.</p>\n\n<h3>--default-layer</h3>\n\n<p>This determines the default layer that KABOOM will affect if you are using it<br/>\nin another script. This option only affects calls of KABOOM.NOW() that do not<br/>\ngive the script a layer to use.</p>\n\n<h3>--drawings-only</h3>\n\n<p>If this is on, then the script will only search for drawings to manipulate and<br/>\nwill ignore all other tokens.</p>\n\n<h3>--walls</h3>\n\n<p>Turn walls on to force the script to obey walls on the dynamic lighting layer.<br/>\nIf it is off, then walls will be ignored when calculating distances thrown.</p>\n\n<h1>Globalconfig options</h1>\n\n<p>These options can only be changed through the Script library panel at the API page.</p>\n\n<h3>GM only</h3>\n\n<p>This setting changes whether you want to restrict the use of this command to GMs only or allow<br/>\naccess to players as well. KABOOM will still require that players select a token before using the<br/>\ncommand, but this may be changed in the future to accept @{target1|token_id} macros.</p>\n\n<h3>Explosion ratio</h3>\n\n<p>This ratio determines what the area of effect for KABOOM explosions will be if one is<br/>\nnot specified. By default, the script multiplies the effect power by this number to<br/>\nuse as the effect radius. It is suggested to keep close to 2, but we won&#39;t complain<br/>\nif you go crazy.</p>\n"

There is an option to choose other for the sheet, which will disable the few sheet-specific shortcuts. It should work with most any sheet or no sheet at all. The first time you run the script, it will ask you to choose which sheet you are using. You can change this behavior with !report --config|sheet\rYou can either select a set of tokens to work with, or if you select no tokens, it will assume all tokens on the Object/Token layer. This behavior can be altered using keywords, described below. The basic syntax is:\r`!report --[queries] ---[buttonline] ----[keywords]`\r****\r### Queries\rQueries are constructed using\r`t|attribute` to poll a token attribute\r`c|attribute` to poll a character sheet attribute\r**Examples**\r`--t|name` would return a report of all selected token names\r`--c|strength` would return a report of all strength values on the character sheets of the selected tokens\rFor character sheets, the script will try to pull a value from the character journal first, and if that does not exist, the installed character sheet.\r### Dividers\rYou may not always want each attribute reported on its own line. You can add a code after the attribute name(not the alias) to use something either than a line return between attributes\r**comma (`,`)** Adds three non-breaking spaces between this attribute and the next, keeping them on the same line when possible.\r**period (`.`)** Adds a vertical pipe between this attribute and the next, keeping them on the same line when possible.\r**dash (`-`)** Adds a thin gray horizontal rule between this attribute and the next.\r**Hashtag (`#`)** Adds a bit of horizontal space between this attribute and the next.\r_Examples:_\r`!report --t|emits_bright_light,|Bright-Light t|bright_light_distance|Distance t|emits_low_light,|Low-Light t|low_light_distance|Distance ---light`\rwill return this Bright Light and Distance on the first line of each record amd Low-Light and its Distance on the second, instead of each value taking up its own line\r\r### Aliases\rThere are times in the report when you would not like `has_bright_light_vision` in the report. You can substitute an alias for the attribute name that will display in chat. For this, just add another pipe after the query and type an alias.\r\rFor example, if a token has 60 feet of Night Vision:\r`t|night_vision_distance`\rmight produce:\rT: night_vision_distance = 60\rbut\r`t|night_vision_distance?NV`\rwould yield:\rT: NV= 60\r\r### Buttonline\rThe buttonline is a string containing text and Ability or API Command buttons. These are formed using the normal syntax for such things with a few exceptions.\rIn order to keep the Roll20 parser from resolving queries and attribute calls before the script gets them, they need to be written slightly differently.\r_Examples:_\r**@{token|name}** is written as **A{token|name}**\r**?{question|default_answer}** is written as Q**{question|default_answer}**\r\rFurther, for a handful of scripts, the Reporter API will attempt to parse the code so that each buttonline refers to the specific token being reported on. Currently **Token Mod**, **ChatSetAttr**, and **Supernotes** are supported.\r\r### Filters\rThere are four types of operator.\r`+` only includes the token/character pairs that matches the query\r`-` excludes any token/character pair that exactly matches the query\r`~` only includes any character that is a partial match for the query\r`^` excludes any character that is a partial match for the query\rthus:\r`!report||-|c|name|Goblin` will return all tokens that are not represented by the Goblin character sheet.\r`!report||~|c|name|Goblin` will return any tokens that are represented by the Goblin or Hobgoblin character sheet.\r`!report||-|c|npc|1||+|t| has_night_vision|true` will exclude all NPCs (leaving only PCs), and then only return those that have nightvision set.\rFilters do not support an alias, because they are never displayed in the final report.\rFilters are executed sequentially, with each filter working on the result from the last, so some logic is required for best results.\rFilters are case insensitive.\rThere is as yet, no way to test for an empty, or undefined value, however, the keyword `hideempty|true` will cause the report to suppress the display of empty values.\r\r### Special Codes\rReporter contains a few special codes for common cases, to make macro writing easier. You can put thes in place of normal commands:\r`--vision` as the Query will replace any declared query line with one designed to report most vision situations. It will give values for whether the token has sight, night vision and what the distance of any night vision is.\r`---vision` as the Buttonline will replace any declared button line with a buttonline designed to handle most cases of vision and darkvision.\r`--light` as the Query will replace any declared query line with one designed to report most lighting situations. It will give values for the amount of light, distance and what type.\r`---light` as the Buttonline will replace any declared button line with a buttonline designed to handle most cases of lighting.\r`---actions` as the Buttonline will replace any declared button line with a buttonline made up of the token action buttons associate with the character. This is designed for synergy with the Token Action Maker script, but is not essential. Not that the token actions created by this command cannot contain roll templates and will not convert the {selected|commandname} structure where it might appear in an ability. This requires very careful parsing and is best avoided. It should work flawlessly with Token Action Maker commands, with the exception of the *Check* and *Save* buttons (which it will skip), for the reasons just mentioned.\r\r### Keywords\rkeywords change the overall appearance or scope of the report. They are separated from the rest of the report by four dashes and must come at the end.\r`layer|[gmlayer|objects|map|walls|tracker|all]` will constrain the report to a particular layer or all layers at once, so long as no tokens are selected. If any tokens are selected, Reporter will default to the layer the selected tokens are on. This makes it easier for instance to check the vision settings of tokens on the token layer and the gmlayer simultaneously, or to ping pull to note tokens on the gm layer without switching manually to that layer.  \rIf the layer keyword all is used the report will be on all token/character pairs on all layers. In this case, a layer character will appear on each subhead line of the report to let you know which layer the token is on. \rIf the layer keyword tracker is used the report will be on all token/character pairs on the Turn Tracker as if it were a layer. In this case, a layer character will appear on each subhead line of the report to let you know which layer the token is on. If you click on the layer token, it will switch the token from the GM/Notes layer to the  Token/Objects layer and back.\r`compact|[true|false]` _(default=false):_ The compact mode shows the token image at half size, and eliminates the second line of the report subhead, since it is not always desired. You may have a very large report you want to see better, or you may be using a sheet that does not support the default values. Currently the second line of the subhead only references the _D&D 5th Edition by Roll20_  and _Pathfinder Second Edition by Roll20_ Sheets. \r`showheader|[true|false]` _(default=true):_ This will control whether the header will display at the top of the report. \r`showfooter|[true|false]` _(default=true):_ This will control whether the footer will display at the bottom of the report. \r`printbutton|[true|false]` _(default=true):_ This will control whether the print button will display on each line of the report. \r`notesbutton|[true|false]` _(default=false):_ This will control whether a notes button will display on each line of the report. This notes button will return the token notes for the token on that line. The visibility of the notes button is controlled by the visibility keyword. If the visibility is *gm*, it will use a !gmnote command, if the If the visibility is *whisper*, it will use a !selftnote command, and if the visibility is *all*, it will use a !pcnote command. \r`visibility|[gm|whisper|all]` _(default=gm):_ This will determine how the report is presented. *gm* is whispered to the gm, *whisper* is whispered to the user who sent the command, *all* is posted openly for all to see. \r`showfooter|[true|false]` _(default=true):_ This will control whether the footer will display at the bottom of the report. \r`source|[true|false]` _(default=true):_ if source is set to false, the C and T characters that show whether an attribute comes fromthe token or the sheet will not be displayed. Use this is they are a distraction. \r`charactersheetlink|[true|false]` _(default=true):_ if this keyword is set to false, the link to open the token*s corresponding character sheet will not display \r`subtitle|[true|false]` _(default=true):_ if this keyword is set to false, the line directly below the character name will not display. (This is also the default in Compact mode). This may be desirable if not using the _D&D 5th Edition by Roll20_  or _Pathfinder Second Edition by Roll20_ Sheets. \r`ignoreselected|[true|false]` _(default=false):_ if this keyword is set to true, the search will not be preset to whichever tokens are selected. The report will run as if no tokens were selected, following whatever layer criteria might have been specified. \r`npcsubstitutions[true|false]` _(default=true):_ if this keyword is set to false, the script will not automatically substitute npc attributes for their PC counterparts (ex: npc_senses for passive_wisdom).This is good for sheets that are not the _D&D 5th Edition by Roll20_  or _Pathfinder Second Edition by Roll20_ Sheets. \r`sort|attribute` _(default is the raw order):_ This keyword will sort the final list. Most of the sorts are confined to the token attributes, since they require internal code and if they refer to a sheet may return poor or no results if the sheet does not have the proper attributes. Currently the following values can be sorted on:  \r- charName: character name. Sheet must have a *name* attribute.\r- charNameI: character name, inverse order. Sheet must have a *name* attribute.\r- tokenName: token name\r- tokenNameI: token name, inverse order.\r- bar1: token bar1 value\r- bar1I: token bar1 value, inverse order.\r- bar2: token bar2 value\r- bar2I: token bar2 value, inverse order.\r- bar3: token bar3 value\r- bar3I: token bar3 value, inverse order.\r- cr - Challenge Rating. D&D 5th Edition by Roll20 Sheet only\r- crI - Challenge Rating, inverse order. D&D 5th Edition by Roll20 Sheet only\r`title|Title|` If this is present in the keywords, the string in between pipes will be placed at the top of the report. If you only want the custom title to display, be sure turn off the header with showheader|false.\r`handout|Handoutname|` If this is present in the keywords, the report will be sent to a handout instead of chat. This can allow a report to remain usable without scrolling through the chat. It can also be used as a sort of floating palette. Reports in handouts can be updated. Running the macro again will regenerate the table, as will pressing the Repeat button. The string in between pipes will be used as the name of the report handout. If no handout by that name exists, Reporter will create one and post a link in chat to open it. The title must be placed between two pipes. handout|My Handout| will work. handout|My Handout will break.\rA report Handout automatically creates a horizontal rule at the top of the handout. Anything typed manually above that rule will be persistent. Reporter will not overwrite it. You can use this area to create Journal Command Buttons to generate new reports or to give some context to the existing report. All updates are live.\r**Supernotes Buttons**\rThese are small buttons that will appear on each line of the report that call up Supernotes commands. These buttons require Supernotes to be installed (Available from the Roll20 One Click installer). If Supernotes is not installed, the buttons will still display but will have no effect. If the report is in the Chat tab, the notes will display in the chat tab, and if the report is set to be in a handout, the notes will in the handout, directly below the report. This can be used to create a handout that can run a report and display notes below. An example use could be a handout that can read map pins and display the notes for each map pin, making an interactive city guide. \r`tokennotesbutton|[true|false]` _(default=false):_  If this keyword is set to true, the report will place a small shortcut button to return the contents of the reported tokens GM Notes field.\r`charnotesbutton|[true|false]` _(default=false):_  If this keyword is set to true, the report will place a small shortcut button to return the contents of the GM Notes field of the character assigned to the reported token.\r`biobutton|[true|false]` _(default=false):_  If this keyword is set to true, the report will place a small shortcut button to return the contents of the Bio Notes field of the character assigned to the reported token.\r`avatarbutton|[true|false]` _(default=false):_  If this keyword is set to true, the report will place a small shortcut button to return the Avatar of the character assigned to the reported token.\r`tooltipbutton|[true|false]` _(default=false):_  If this keyword is set to true, the report will place a small shortcut button to return contents of the reported tokens Tooltips field.\r`imagebutton|[true|false]` _(default=false):_  If this keyword is set to true, the report will place a small shortcut button to return images from the Bio field of the character assigned to the reported token.\rSee this thread in the Roll20 Forums for more details - [Reporter Feedback thread](https://app.roll20.net/forum/post/10381135/script-reporter-1-dot-x)",

There is an option to choose other for the sheet, which will disable the few sheet-specific shortcuts. It should work with most any sheet or no sheet at all. The first time you run the script, it will ask you to choose which sheet you are using. You can change this behavior with !report --config|sheet<br/>\nYou can either select a set of tokens to work with, or if you select no tokens, it will assume all tokens on the Object/Token layer. This behavior can be altered using keywords, described below. The basic syntax is:<br/>\n<code>!report --[queries] ---[buttonline] ----[keywords]</code></p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<h3>Queries</h3>\n\n<p>Queries are constructed using<br/>\n<code>t|attribute</code> to poll a token attribute<br/>\n<code>c|attribute</code> to poll a character sheet attribute<br/>\n<strong>Examples</strong><br/>\n<code>--t|name</code> would return a report of all selected token names<br/>\n<code>--c|strength</code> would return a report of all strength values on the character sheets of the selected tokens<br/>\nFor character sheets, the script will try to pull a value from the character journal first, and if that does not exist, the installed character sheet.</p>\n\n<h3>Dividers</h3>\n\n<p>You may not always want each attribute reported on its own line.

A button will be output to chat to trigger the target selection. We are also triggering an ability named FlamingSphereDam that was made on the GenericSpellAoE character sheet ahead of time (the --sheet command tells where to look for the ability, and overrides the default search location of the selected character). The ability automatically rolls the damage for the spell, using a 5E template.\r**!Spawn {{\r&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--name| GenericSpellAoE\r&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--targets| 1\r&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--offset| 1,0\r&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--size| 1,1\r&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--side| 2\r&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--order | toFront\r&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--light| 40,20\r&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--sheet| GenericSpellAoE\r&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--ability| FlamingSphereDam\r}}**\r\r_For more examples, visit the forum link above_",

Uses a rollable table token called GenericSpellAOE, sets the size of each to a single 1x1 square, sets side to &#39;7&#39;, emits LDL dim light in 10ft radius, and performs a ToFront operation on the globes<br/>\n<strong>!Spawn {{<br/>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--name| GenericSpellAoE<br/>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--qty| 4<br/>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--placement| burst 2<br/>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--offset| 0,0<br/>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--size| 1,1<br/>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--side| 7<br/>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--order | toFront<br/>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--light| 10,-5<br/>\n}}</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>2.</strong> The next example casts a Flaming Sphere adjacent to a <em>target</em>, rather than the selected token, using our GenericSpellAoE rollable table token again. A button will be output to chat to trigger the target selection. We are also triggering an ability named FlamingSphereDam that was made on the GenericSpellAoE character sheet ahead of time (the --sheet command tells where to look for the ability, and overrides the default search location of the selected character). The ability automatically rolls the damage for the spell, using a 5E template.<br/>\n<strong>!Spawn {{<br/>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--name| GenericSpellAoE<br/>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--targets| 1<br/>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--offset| 1,0<br/>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--size| 1,1<br/>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--side| 2<br/>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--order | toFront<br/>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--light| 40,20<br/>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--sheet| GenericSpellAoE<br/>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--ability| FlamingSphereDam<br/>\n}}</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>For more examples, visit the forum link above</em></p>\n"

In the case of NPCs, this includes all Actions. (PC/NPC)\n- **trait**s Creates a button for each trait. PCs can have quite a number of these, so it is not recommended to run this command on PCs. (PC*/NPC)\n- **pc** creates full suite of buttons for everything but traits. Although this will also work on npcs, the intent is to not include trait buttons for pcs, which can get rather numerous. \n- **bonusactions** Creates a button for each bonus action. This will be ignored on PCs since only NPC sheets have a repeating attribute for bonus actions. (NPC)\n- **reactions** Creates a button for each reaction.

Otherwise the script will try to create Token Actions for the 5e sheet. Until all sheets have a uniform sheet identifier attribute, this is necessary. In cases where there is an action cost, it will be indicated in the button name as `Action<#>`.\nYou can create specific classes of abilities by using the following arguments separated by spaces:\n- **pf2** *Required on all PF2 commands*\n- **attacks** Creates a button for each attack. TAM will append a '-M' or '-R' after the name to distinguish melee from ranged. Each Attack will have a two buttons immediately following for Attack 2 and Attack 3. These will be abbreviated using the first two characters from each word in the Attack. Example `Silver Dagger` `SiDa-2` `SiDa-3` (PC/NPC)\n- **reactive**  Creates a button for each reaction (NPC)\n- **offensive**  Creates a button for each offensive ability (PC/NPC)\n- **spells** Creates a button that calls up a chat menu of all spells the character can cast.

You can even drag multiple condtions onto a single token.\r\r## Commands\r\r```\r!token-condition\r```\r\rDisplay this help.\r\r## Controlling Mirroring\rFor more fine-grained control, you can add a bracketed block to the character name and specify various `|` delimited tags.\r\rUse the `mirror` tag to specify properties to mirror.\r\r```\rCondition: Confused [mirror:aura1_radius]\r```\r\rThe `mirror` tag takes as argument a comma delimited list of properties and can include spaces around the punctuation:\r\r```\rCondition: Confused [mirror : aura1_radius, aura2_radius , aura1_color ,aura2_color]\r```\r\rProperties can be preceded by an operation: `+`, `-`\r* `+` -- Add the property to the list that are mirrored. (default)\r* `-` -- Remove the property to the list that are mirrored.\r\r```\rCondition: Confused [mirror: -width, -height]\r```\r\rIn addition to the `mirror` tag, you can list several adjustments tags that are applied when mirroring properties. Adjustment tags are separated from their adjustment by a `:`.\r* `rotation`\r* `width`\r* `height`\r* `left`\r* `top`\r\rAdjustment values are prefixed with one of several operations:\r* `=` -- Always set the propery to this value if it would change.\r* `+` -- Add this value to the property when it is changed.\r* `-` -- Subtract this value from the property when it is changed.\r* `*` -- Multipy by this value when the property is changed.\r* `/` -- Divide by this value when the property is changed.\r\rFor example, to have the width always 3 times larger than the target token, you could use:\r\r```\rCondition: Confused [width:*3]\r```\r\rAdditionally, you could adjust the rotation to be 90 degrees further than the target token:\r\r```\rCondition: Confused [rotation:+90|width:*3]\r```\r\rNumbers can be suffixed with u, g, etc just like with TokenMod.\r\rThe below tag can be specified to cause a token to be pushed below when it is created. Note: This is a one time adjustment currently.\r\rHere is an example where the token is placed below and remains slightly larger than the target token:\r\r```\rCondition: Confused [below|width:*1.2|height:*1.2]\r```\r\r**[EXPERIMENTAL]** The `forward` tag works just like the mirror tag, save that any changes to the listed properties are reverted after they are mirrored forward. This is an incomplete feature which will probably get changed later, but is provided for experimentation.\r\r## Name Prefixes\r\rIn addition to the `Condition` name prefix, there are several more. Prefixing with any of the following will make the character active for TokenCondition, with varying default behavior:\r\r* `Condition` -- Mirrors: left, top, width, height, lastmove, controlledby, bar1_value, bar1_max, bar1_link, bar2_value, bar2_max, bar2_link, bar3_value, bar3_max, bar3_link, represents, statusmarkers, and tint_color.\r* `Decoration` -- Is below and mirrors: left, top, width, height, lastmove, and controlledby.\r* `Mount` -- Is below and mirrors: left, top, width, height, lastmove, controlledby, and rotation.\r\r### Character Name Examples\r\rA speaking condtion that floats to the top right of a token and does not change size:\r```\rCondition: Speaking [left:+.75|top:-.75|mirror:-width,-height]\r```\r\rA spirit guardians decoration that is sized correctly and follows the token:\r```\rDecoration: Spirit Guardians [width:7g|height:7g]\r\r```\r\rA horse mount that is 3 times longer than it is tall, and scaled for the token that rides it. Additionally, it's rotation is corrected to account for the direction the horse image faces:\r```\rMount: Horse [rotation:+90|width:*3]\r```",

Adjustment tags are separated from their adjustment by a <code>:</code>.<br/>\n* <code>rotation</code><br/>\n* <code>width</code><br/>\n* <code>height</code><br/>\n* <code>left</code><br/>\n* <code>top</code></p>\n\n<p>Adjustment values are prefixed with one of several operations:<br/>\n* <code>=</code> -- Always set the propery to this value if it would change.<br/>\n* <code>+</code> -- Add this value to the property when it is changed.<br/>\n* <code>-</code> -- Subtract this value from the property when it is changed.<br/>\n* <code>*</code> -- Multipy by this value when the property is changed.<br/>\n* <code>/</code> -- Divide by this value when the property is changed.</p>\n\n<p>For example, to have the width always 3 times larger than the target token, you could use:</p>\n\n<p><code><br/>\nCondition: Confused [width:*3]<br/>\n</code></p>\n\n<p>Additionally, you could adjust the rotation to be 90 degrees further than the target token:</p>\n\n<p><code><br/>\nCondition: Confused [rotation:+90|width:*3]<br/>\n</code></p>\n\n<p>Numbers can be suffixed with u, g, etc just like with TokenMod.</p>\n\n<p>The below tag can be specified to cause a token to be pushed below when it is created. Note: This is a one time adjustment currently.</p>\n\n<p>Here is an example where the token is placed below and remains slightly larger than the target token:</p>\n\n<p><code><br/>\nCondition: Confused [below|width:*1.2|height:*1.2]<br/>\n</code></p>\n\n<p><strong>[EXPERIMENTAL]</strong> The <code>forward</code> tag works just like the mirror tag, save that any changes to the listed properties are reverted after they are mirrored forward. This is an incomplete feature which will probably get changed later, but is provided for experimentation.</p>\n\n<h2>Name Prefixes</h2>\n\n<p>In addition to the <code>Condition</code> name prefix, there are several more. Prefixing with any of the following will make the character active for TokenCondition, with varying default behavior:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>Condition</code> -- Mirrors: left, top, width, height, lastmove, controlledby, bar1<em>value, bar1</em>max, bar1<em>link, bar2</em>value, bar2<em>max, bar2</em>link, bar3<em>value, bar3</em>max, bar3<em>link, represents, statusmarkers, and tint</em>color.</li>\n<li><code>Decoration</code> -- Is below and mirrors: left, top, width, height, lastmove, and controlledby.</li>\n<li><code>Mount</code> -- Is below and mirrors: left, top, width, height, lastmove, controlledby, and rotation.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Character Name Examples</h3>\n\n<p>A speaking condtion that floats to the top right of a token and does not change size:<br/>\n<code><br/>\nCondition: Speaking [left:+.75|top:-.75|mirror:-width,-height]<br/>\n</code></p>\n\n<p>A spirit guardians decoration that is sized correctly and follows the token:<br/>\n```<br/>\nDecoration: Spirit Guardians [width:7g|height:7g]</p>\n\n<p>```</p>\n\n<p>A horse mount that is 3 times longer than it is tall, and scaled for the token that rides it. Additionally, it&#39;s rotation is corrected to account for the direction the horse image faces:<br/>\n<code><br/>\nMount: Horse [rotation:+90|width:*3]<br/>\n</code></p>\n<div id='patreon-link' class='alert alert-info'><div style='float: left; width: 80px;'><a target='_blank' href='https://www.patreon.com/shdwjk'><img src='https://app.roll20.net/images/patreon_logo.png'></a></div><div style='margin-left: 100px;'>You can support development of this script by contributing to the <a target='_blank' href='https://www.patreon.com/shdwjk'>Patreon Campaign</a> of the author. <div style='font-size: 0.9em;'>This Patreon campaign is not affiliated with Roll20; as such, contributions are voluntary and Roll20 cannot provide support or refunds for contributions.</div></div></div>"

Manipulations of the returned array will not change the stored array.\n* `setList( id , list )` -- Sets the array for an `id`.  The current array for the id will be replaced.  Returns a copy of the stored array, as with `getList( id )`.  Only one copy of a value in the `list` will be retained, duplicates are removed.\n* `deleteList( id )` -- Removes the array for an `id`.  Returns the emtpy array `[]`.\n* `removeFromList( id, list )` -- Removes the values in the `list` argument from the stored array for the `id`.

        "description": "# Calendar\n\nThis simple script is used to help keep track of the current in-game date for your game. It was designed to be extremely simple to use and update.\n\nIt currently supports 4 calendars:\n\n- **gregorian** - the calendar used in (most of) the real world.\n- **harptos** - the calendar used in the Forgotten Realms (12 months of 30 days, with 5 extra days between months and a sixth extra day every 4 years).\n- **barovian** - the lunar calendar used in Barovia (12 months of 28 days).\n- **golarion** - the Golarion calendar used in Pathfinder (similar to the Gregorian calendar with different names, but leap years are every 8 years)\n\n## Setup\n\nOnce this script is installed in your game, setup is easy.\n\nFirst, set the type of calendar you want to use (in this example, I'll use harptos):\n\n```\n!cal type harptos\n```\n\nSecondly, set the date, which goes `day month year`:\n\n```\n!cal set 20 1 1491\n```\n\nSince the harptos calendar has days that fall between months, you can also use the name of that day and the year:\n\n```\n!cal set midsummer 1490\n!cal set feastofthemoon 1490\n!cal set Feast of the Moon 1490\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nOnce the calendar has been set up, it's pretty easy to use.\n\n\n**Display**\n\nTo see the current date (this command is available to everyone):\n\n```\n!cal\n```\n\n**Increment Day**\n\nTo make the calendar go to the next day (GM only command), use:\n\n```\n!cal next\n```\n\n**Decrement Day**\n\nIf you incremented the day by accident or too many times, you can always go back (GM only command) using this:\n\n```\n!cal previous\n```\n\n## Full API\n\n**Calendar Version 1.2**\n\n\n```\n!cal\n```\n\n*(everyone)* Displays the current in-game date.\n\n*Aliased by: ``!cal display``*\n\n---\n\n```\n!cal next\n```\n\n*(GM)* Advances the in-game date by 1 day.\n\n*Aliased by: `!cal ++`, `!cal increment`*\n\n---\n\n```\n!cal add [number of days]\n```\n\n*(GM)* Advances the in-game date by a given number of days.\n\n- [number of days] (integer (positive)) - the number of days to advance the date by\n\n*Aliased by: `!cal += [number of days]`, `!cal set +[number of days]`*\n \n\n---\n\n```\n!cal subtract [number of days]\n```\n\n*(GM)* Decreases the in-game date by a given number of days.\n\n- [number of days] (integer (positive)) - the number of days to decrease the date by\n\n*Aliased by: `!cal -= [number of days]`, `!cal set -[number of days]`*\n \n\n---\n\n```\n!cal previous\n```\n\n*(GM)* Regresses the in-game date by 1 day.\n\n*Aliased by: `!cal --`, `!cal prev`, `!cal decrement`*\n \n\n---\n\n```\n!cal system\n```\n\n*(everyone)* Displays the current calendar system.\n\n*Aliased by: `!cal type`*\n \n\n---\n\n```\n!cal system [system]\n```\n\n*(GM)* Sets the current calendar system. The date may need to be set again after using this command.\n\n- [system] (text) - the calendar system, one of: gregorian, harptos, barovian, golarion\n\n*Aliased by: `!cal type [system]`*\n \n\n---\n\n```\n!cal set [day] [month] [year]\n```\n\n*(GM)* Sets the current in-game date.\n\n- [day] (integer) - the day of the month (usually 1-31)\n- [month] (integer|text) - the month in the year (usually 1-12), or the name of the month (e.g. January)\n- [year] (integer) - the year\n \n\n---\n\n```\n!cal set [special day] ([year])\n```\n\n*(GM)* Sets the current in-game date using the name of a day that falls between months, such as with the Harptos calendar.\n\n- [special day] (text) - the name of the special day, with or without spaces (e.g. Feast of the Moon, feastofthemoon)\n- [year] (optional, integer) - the year\n \n\n---\n\n```\n!cal set <+->[number of days]\n```\n\n*(GM)* Depending on whether you prepend a + or a - to the number, adds or subtracts a number of days from the current in-game date.\n\n- [number of days] (integer) - the number of days to add or subtract from the current in-game date\n\n*Aliased by: `!cal add [number of days], !cal += [number of days], !cal subtract [number of days], !cal -= [number of days]`*\n \n\n---\n\n```\n!cal whisper [whisper mode]\n```\n\n*(GM)* Turns GM whisper mode on or off. If on, only the GM can use the calendar script to see the current date.\n\n- [whisper mode] (on|off|toggle) - on turns on GM whisper mode, off turns off GM whisper mode, toggle toggles GM whisper mode\n \n\n---\n\n```\n!cal help\n```\n\n*(everyone)* Displays this help message.",

It was designed to be extremely simple to use and update.</p>\n\n<p>It currently supports 4 calendars:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>gregorian</strong> - the calendar used in (most of) the real world.</li>\n<li><strong>harptos</strong> - the calendar used in the Forgotten Realms (12 months of 30 days, with 5 extra days between months and a sixth extra day every 4 years).</li>\n<li><strong>barovian</strong> - the lunar calendar used in Barovia (12 months of 28 days).</li>\n<li><strong>golarion</strong> - the Golarion calendar used in Pathfinder (similar to the Gregorian calendar with different names, but leap years are every 8 years)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Setup</h2>\n\n<p>Once this script is installed in your game, setup is easy.</p>\n\n<p>First, set the type of calendar you want to use (in this example, I&#39;ll use harptos):</p>\n\n<p><code><br/>\n!cal type harptos<br/>\n</code></p>\n\n<p>Secondly, set the date, which goes <code>day month year</code>:</p>\n\n<p><code><br/>\n!cal set 20 1 1491<br/>\n</code></p>\n\n<p>Since the harptos calendar has days that fall between months, you can also use the name of that day and the year:</p>\n\n<p><code><br/>\n!cal set midsummer 1490<br/>\n!cal set feastofthemoon 1490<br/>\n!cal set Feast of the Moon 1490<br/>\n</code></p>\n\n<h2>Usage</h2>\n\n<p>Once the calendar has been set up, it&#39;s pretty easy to use.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Display</strong></p>\n\n<p>To see the current date (this command is available to everyone):</p>\n\n<p><code><br/>\n!cal<br/>\n</code></p>\n\n<p><strong>Increment Day</strong></p>\n\n<p>To make the calendar go to the next day (GM only command), use:</p>\n\n<p><code><br/>\n!cal next<br/>\n</code></p>\n\n<p><strong>Decrement Day</strong></p>\n\n<p>If you incremented the day by accident or too many times, you can always go back (GM only command) using this:</p>\n\n<p><code><br/>\n!cal previous<br/>\n</code></p>\n\n<h2>Full API</h2>\n\n<p><strong>Calendar Version 1.2</strong></p>\n\n<p><code><br/>\n!cal<br/>\n</code></p>\n\n<p><em>(everyone)</em> Displays the current in-game date.</p>\n\n<p><em>Aliased by: <code>!cal display</code></em></p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p><code><br/>\n!cal next<br/>\n</code></p>\n\n<p><em>(GM)</em> Advances the in-game date by 1 day.</p>\n\n<p><em>Aliased by: <code>!cal ++</code>, <code>!cal increment</code></em></p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p><code><br/>\n!cal add [number of days]<br/>\n</code></p>\n\n<p><em>(GM)</em> Advances the in-game date by a given number of days.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>[number of days] (integer (positive)) - the number of days to advance the date by</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>Aliased by: <code>!cal += [number of days]</code>, <code>!cal set +[number of days]</code></em></p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p><code><br/>\n!cal subtract [number of days]<br/>\n</code></p>\n\n<p><em>(GM)</em> Decreases the in-game date by a given number of days.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>[number of days] (integer (positive)) - the number of days to decrease the date by</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>Aliased by: <code>!cal -= [number of days]</code>, <code>!cal set -[number of days]</code></em></p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p><code><br/>\n!cal previous<br/>\n</code></p>\n\n<p><em>(GM)</em> Regresses the in-game date by 1 day.</p>\n\n<p><em>Aliased by: <code>!cal --</code>, <code>!cal prev</code>, <code>!cal decrement</code></em></p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p><code><br/>\n!cal system<br/>\n</code></p>\n\n<p><em>(everyone)</em> Displays the current calendar system.</p>\n\n<p><em>Aliased by: <code>!cal type</code></em></p>\n\n<hr/>\n\n<p><code><br/>\n!cal system [system]<br/>\n</code></p>\n\n<p><em>(GM)</em> Sets the current calendar system.

        "description": "**Campaign Survey** *([Forum thread](https://app.roll20.net/forum/post/10675897/script-campaign-survey))* is a script that tries to give the user a bird-eye view of their campaign, reporting on how much space is taken up by which elements. Some elements have more of an impact on game performance than others, and in general, the script tries to show them in descending order of importance. Information on improving Roll20 performance can be found on [Roll20 system Recommendations](https://help.roll20.net/hc/en-us/articles/4403128607127-Roll20-System-Recommendations) and [Optimizing Roll20 Performance](https://help.roll20.net/hc/en-us/articles/360041544654) in the Help Center. The !survey command can be followed by ' --' and one or more of the following keywords:\r\r**characters** A list of all character sheets in a campaign in descending order of complexity. All entries are linked to the sheet so you can quickly open them and investigate. Each character is appended by the number of attributes it contains. This will vary depending on the sheet used, and complexity of the character. Look for exceptionally high outliers, typically spell caster with many spells.\r\r**attributes** A list of all character attributes in a campaign. This is a very rough indicator of the size of the Firebase DB, when combined with the number of graphics placed on the VTT. A high number will likely affect loading time, and may contribute to lag. Character sheets, and the number of graphics and drawings on the VTT are the greatest contributors to game size.\r\r**abilities** A list of all character sheets in a campaign in descending order of number of abilities (macros resident on character sheets). Abilities can be quite long, but they are still relatively low impact compared to attributes. All entries are linked to the sheet so you can quickly open them and investigate. Each character is appended by the number of abilities it contains. Look for exceptionally high outliers, typically Macro Character Sheets. In this case, a high number of macros is rarely an issue, since this practice serves to consolidate a lot of a games automation in one place. For more information see, [Macro Character Sheet](https://tinyurl.com/3jn6jzrr) in the [Roll20 Community Wiki](https://tinyurl.com/mtz43sun).\r\r**pages** A list of all pages in a campaign, along with the number of graphics on that page. Graphics are listed as total graphics/count of tokens. Look for exceptionally high count outliers. More graphics = more Firebase items to track. Number of graphics is more likely to be a lag concern on Dynamically Lit pages.\r\r**lighting** A list of all dynamically lit pages in a campaign, along with the number of sighted tokens, light-emitting tokens, plus DL paths, and the total number of points in those paths. Simplify when possible. There is overlap in the report, if one token is emitting low and bright light, it is listed in both counts. See [System Requirements & Best Practices](https://help.roll20.net/hc/en-us/articles/360045793374-System-Requirements-Best-Practices) in the Help Center for performance help, or Help Center's [Dynamic Lighting headquarters](https://help.roll20.net/hc/en-us/categories/360003712734-Dynamic-Lighting). If Dynamic Lighting does not seem to be working, try going through the [Dynamic Lighting Checklist](https://help.roll20.net/hc/en-us/articles/360044771413-Dynamic-Lighting-Checklist).\r\r**graphics** A list of all graphics in a campaign, followed by the number of times they are used. You may occasionally see a 1x and a say, 6x for the same graphic. This likely indicates that an item was dragged in from a marketplace source and used again from the art library. Using the alternate arguments of **ugraphics** or **mgraphics** will constrain the report to User Art Library or Marketplace items respectively. Marketplace items can be identified by a thin black border around the graphics frame. Clicking on a graphic lists all occurrences of the identified graphic in a campaign, broken out by page, with the source of the graphic clearly labeled. Information on best practices for creating and uploading graphics can be found in [Best Practices for Files on Roll20](https://help.roll20.net/hc/en-us/articles/360037256634-Best-Practices-for-Files-on-Roll20s) in the Help Center\r\r**handouts** A list of all handouts in a campaign. All entries are linked to the handout so you can quickly open them and investigate. Handouts are very low impact items, and are unlikely to contribute to lag or increased loading time except in extreme numbers.\r\r**macros** A list of all macros in a campaign. Each macro will play the macro when clicked. Macros are low impact items.\r\r**tables A list of all tables in a campaign in alphabetical order. All entries are linked to a roll on that table. Clicking on the name will produce a gmroll, clicking on the number of entries will perform an inline roll. Tables are low impact items.\r\r**texts** A list of all text obejcts in a campaign. Text objects are low impact items. There may be some entries for empty texts. This can happen when the user clicks with the text editing tool in error and then abandons the process to do something else. Empty texts are not a serious problem, but in order to clean things up and make it easier not select them by accident. There is a tool to remove all empty texts. Use with caution.\r\r**decks** A list of all card decks in a campaign, along with a card count for each deck. Decks are a relatively low-impact item, unless there are an inordinate number of cards in play on the VTT.\r\r**tracks** A list of all jukebox tracks in a campaign. Clicking on the track will play the track. Each track name has a button next to it that will stop playing that track. Jukebox tracks are streaming files and will not affect loading time. They are unlikely to contribute to lag, except in cases where there is already low bandwidth.\r\r**players** A list of all players in a campaign, along with their player id, and avatar color. Clicking the player color box calls up a character list report formatted like the characters keyword in descending order of complexity, but is limited to characters for whom the player is listed as a controller. Clicking on the player name will take you to their public Roll20 profile page, in case you need to PM them or can't remember what they are called outside of the game.\r\r**makehandout** Sends the report to a handout named 'Campaign Survey Report'. You can use this with any other keyword or as the sole keyword. Every category on the campaign overview display has a handout option. There is a button at the bottom of the display to directly open the handout. All reports sent to the handout will update in real time. If you want the name of the campaign to appear at the top of every report, put it in the gmnotes of the Campaign Survey Report handout.\r\r**overview** _(optional)_ gives a count of each of the categories. Each category is clickable to send that command to chat or to the report. typiing **!survey --overview**, is the same as typing **!survey**.\r\r**Help** Displays this help information.",

        "previousversions": [],
        "description": "Extends the syntax for Roll20 objects for use in scripts. This script is not intended to stand alone.\n\n### Overridden Functions\nEach function you set to be overridden below will have the normal Roll20 library function overridden with a custom version in this script's `ready` event. Any code executed by other scripts *prior* to this script's `ready` function completing will not benefit from the change. This is most relevant if you want to make use of the overridden `on` function, or use other functions inside another script's `ready` event. Using other overridden functions inside an event other than `ready` which are themselves bound within a `ready` event is guaranteed to function as expected regardless of script load order. For example:\n\n    // Will not be the overridden `on` function if loaded before ESRO\n    on('ready', function() {\n        // Will not be the overridden `on` function if loaded before ESRO\n        on('change:graphic', function(obj, prev) {\n            // Guaranteed to be the overridden `getObj` function regardless of load order\n            var character = getObj('character', obj.get('represents'));\n            ...\n        });\n    });\n\n### Direct Function Access\nYou can access the overridden version of a function directly (whether you have it set to be overridden below or not) from the `bshields.esro` object. For example, `bshields.esro.getObj` is the new version of `getObj`. You can also access the original Roll20 library versions of these functions directly in a similar way, through the `bshields.esro.r20` object. For example, `bshields.esro.r20.getObj` is the original version of `getObj`. Note that `bshields.esro` is not defined until this script's `ready` event completes.\n\n### What Do These New Functions Do?\nThe main purpose of these functions is to wrap objects and enhance their functionality. At this time, that specifically means creating properties that are directly accessible. So, instead of writing `token.set('left', token.get('left') + 70)`, you can write `token.left = token.left + 70` or even `token.left += 70`! Please note that if you wish to set multiple properties at once, it is still recommended that you call the `set` function, eg `token.set({ left: xCoord, top: yCoord })`. Read-only properties such as `_type` cannot have their values set, but you can access them with or without the leading underscore.\n\nThe modified versions of the object finding and creation functions (`getObj`, `Campaign`, `findObjs`, `filterObjs`, `getAllObjs`, and `createObj`) will all return appropriately wrapped objects; the functions that return arrays will return arrays of wrapped objects. The modified version of the event registering function (`on`) will pass wrapped objects to the callbacks of appropriate events. The modified versions of the object layering functions (`toFront` and `toBack`) will *unwrap* the object prior to sending it to Roll20's native `toFront` and `toBack` functions. **Please Note:** if you choose not to override `toFront` and `toBack`, but you *are* manipulating wrapped objects (for example, because you're overriding the object finding and/or creation functions), you must call `unwrap()` when sending the object to either of these ordering functions. If you are overriding the layering functions, the system will correctly handle passing both wrapped and unwrapped objects to them.\n\n#### `notes`, `gmnotes`, and `bio` Properties for Characters and Handouts\nFor these properties on a Character or Handout object, the `get` function is asynchronous. As such, you must call these properties like a function, instead of just treating them like a value. For example:\n\n    var system = findObjs({ type: 'character', name: 'System' })[0];\n    system.bio(function(text) {\n        log(text); // Print the System character's bio to the log\n    });\n\n#### Functions of Wrapped Objects\nIn addition to direct property access, there are some functions available to wrapped objects. The list of available functions includes *all* functions that are normally available to the Roll20 objects (`get`, `set`, `remove`, etc.) even if some (`get` and `set`, specifically) are redundant.\n\n**toString(minimal)**: the `toString` function has been redefined for wrapped objects. Instead of simply outputting \"[object Object]\", it will attempt to produce the JSON data for the object. In corner cases where that is not possible, or if you provide `true` as a parameter to the function, it will return \"[object Roll20Object -Abc_123]\" (using the object's actual `id` instead of `-Abc_123`). In corner cases where it is not possible to include the object's id, the return value will simply be \"[object Roll20Object]\", which at least is still more descriptive than the standard `toString`.\n\n**unwrap()**: the `unwrap` function is available for all wrapped objects to gain access to the original, unwrapped version of the object. This should not be needed under most circumstances, but it is required for `toFront` and `toBack` if you are not overwriting them despite using wrapped objects in your script.\n\n### Wrapping Objects Yourself\nIn addition to overwriting existing Roll20 functions to produce wrapped objects, you can wrap a normal Roll20 object manually by calling `bshields.esro.wrap(obj)`. Assuming no other script has already defined it, this script will also create the function `wrap` as a shorthand to the fully-qualified version, so you can just use `wrap(obj)`. The wrap function will be available regardless of whether you have any or all of the Roll20 functions being overwritten.",

        "name": "ImperialCalendar",
        "script": "ImperialCalendar.js",
        "version": "0.1.3",
        "description": "ImperialCalendar provides a fully featured calendar as used in Traveller, Stars without Number, and other scifi games.  It supports notes (public, private, and player specific) and various display formats.\r\r## Commands\r\r```!cal [<--help|--details|--sparse|--whisper|--set|--note|--remove-note|--show|--show-week|--show-4week|--show-5week|--show-year>|<parameter> ...]```\r\r```!wcal``` -- An alias for `!cal --whisper`\r\r### Date Format\r\rImperialCalendar uses dates of the format `<day>-<year>`, such as `023-1116`.  The leading `0`s are optional, so `001-0001` is the same as `1-1`.  Anywhere you can use a date, you can also use a relative date by using a number prefixed by either `+` or `-`.  These numbers will be used as a day offset from the current day.  You can further suffice these numbers with one of `d`,`w`,`y` to specify days (default), weeks, or years.  (`D`,`W`,`Y` also work.)  In most cases, the `+` is also optional.  In fact, you can leave off the number and only specify a suffice.  `+7d` is the same as `7d`, `+7`, `d`, `D`, `+d`, `+D`, `+1w`, etc.\r\r### Display\r\rThere are two display modes: **Calendar** and **Journal**.\r\r#### Calendar\rShows you days on a grid.  Hover on a day to see it's notes (days with notes have a green background).  Click a day to see the journal for that day.\r\r#### Journal\rShows you the notes for the day or days.  Notes have a button allowing the owner to delete them.  There are buttons by each day for adding notes of each permission type.\r\r### Setting the Date\r`--set|<date>` (GM Only) -- Use `--set` to adjust the current day.  The current day is what all relative days are calculated from and is highlighted yellow in the display.  Anywhere you can omit the day in a command, the current day is used instead.  If you specify an invalid day, the current day is used. \r\r#### Examples\r* `!cal --set|023-1116` -- set the date explicitly to the 23rd day of the year 1116.\r* `!cal --set|+1w` -- set the date relatively by advancing the current date by a week.\r\r### Show Commands\r\r`--show[|<date>[|<date> ..]]` -- use `--show` to show a day.\r\r`--show-week[|<date>]` -- Show the week (Monday-Sunday or the Holiday week) surrounding the provided date or the current date.\r\r`--show-4week[|<date>]` -- As above, but shows also 1 week prior and 2 weeks hence from the date.\r\r`--show-5week[|<date>]` -- As above, but shows 2 weeks prior and 2 weeks hence.\r\r`--show-year[|<date>]` -- Shows the full year including the date.  \r* **Note:** This is the only command that will treat a bare number as a year. `!cal --show-year|1116` is equivalent to `!cal --show-year|001-1116`.\r\r`--between|<date>|<date>` -- Shows all the days between the two dates.  Relative dates are still relative to the current day.\r\r#### Modifiers\r\r`--details` -- Causes a list of days and notes to be shown, rather than a grid calendar. (This is the default for `--show`)\r\r`--sparse` -- Causes a detail view to omit any days without notes.\r\r#### Examples\r* `!cal --show` -- show's the current date.\r* `!cal --show|+1d` -- show's tomorrow.\r* `!cal --show|-1w` -- show's a week ago.\r* `!cal --show|1-1116|10-1116|16-1116` -- show's the 1st, 10th, and 16th days of the year 1116.\r* `!cal --show-week` -- show's the current week.\r* `!cal --show-week|+w` -- show's next week.\r* `!cal --show-year` -- show's the current year.\r* `!cal --between|023-1116|043-1116` -- shows all the days from the 23rd to the 43rd of the year 1116.\r* `!cal --between|023-1116|043-1116 --details --sparse` -- Shows the days with notes from the 23rd to the 43rd of the year 1116.\r\r#### Whisper Examples\r* `!wcal --show` -- Whisper the current day.  Whispering is the only time that notes other than public notes are displayed.\r* `!cal --show --whisper` -- Identical to the above.\r\r\r### Note commands\r`--note[|day][[|who] ...]|<note text>` -- adds a note.  If you omit the day, it is added for the current day.  You can specify who can see a note.  Use `gm` or `private` for a gm only note (also the default, you can just leave it off), `all` for a public note, or some part of a player's name to restrict it to just the matching players.  You can specify multiple `|` separated players.\r\r`--remove-note[|day]|<all|index>` -- removes a note.  If you omit the date, it removes from the current day.  If you specify `all`, it will remove all the notes you created on that day (or all notes if you are the gm). If you specify a number, it will remove that index from the specified day (counting from the beginning, starting at 0).\r\r#### Examples\r* `!cal --note|all|Hi everyone` -- adds a note on the current day for all players.\r* `!cal --note|Secret note.` -- adds a note for just the GM.\r* `!cal --note|tom|Tom's note.` -- adds a note for all players with `tom` in there name (ignoring spaces and capitalization).\r* `!cal --note|sally|tom|bob|Small group note.` -- adds a note for 3 or more players.\r* `!cal --note|10-1116|Bomb goes off.` -- adds a GM note on the 10th of the year 1116.\r* `!cal --note|10-1116|all|A good day to be off planet.` -- adds a note for all players on the 10th of the year 1116.\r* `!cal --remove-note|0` -- removes the first note on the current day.\r* `!cal --remove-note|all` -- removes all the notes on the current day.\r\r\r## Settings\r\rThe settings are accessible via the help screen using `!cal --help`.\r\r### Tool Tips\r\rYou can toggle the tool tips on the buttons in the `--details` display.  Once you know what the buttons do, the tool tips are a bit annoying.  Click the toggle button to adjust them.\r\r### Day Names\r\rClick the name button to change the name.",

      "mdowninstructions": "<p>ImperialCalendar provides a fully featured calendar as used in Traveller, Stars without Number, and other scifi games.  It supports notes (public, private, and player specific) and various display formats.</p>\n\n<h2>Commands</h2>\n\n<p><code>!cal [&lt;--help|--details|--sparse|--whisper|--set|--note|--remove-note|--show|--show-week|--show-4week|--show-5week|--show-year&gt;|&lt;parameter&gt; ...]</code></p>\n\n<p><code>!wcal</code> -- An alias for <code>!cal --whisper</code></p>\n\n<h3>Date Format</h3>\n\n<p>ImperialCalendar uses dates of the format <code>&lt;day&gt;-&lt;year&gt;</code>, such as <code>023-1116</code>.  The leading <code>0</code>s are optional, so <code>001-0001</code> is the same as <code>1-1</code>.  Anywhere you can use a date, you can also use a relative date by using a number prefixed by either <code>+</code> or <code>-</code>.  These numbers will be used as a day offset from the current day.  You can further suffice these numbers with one of <code>d</code>,<code>w</code>,<code>y</code> to specify days (default), weeks, or years.  (<code>D</code>,<code>W</code>,<code>Y</code> also work.)  In most cases, the <code>+</code> is also optional.  In fact, you can leave off the number and only specify a suffice.  <code>+7d</code> is the same as <code>7d</code>, <code>+7</code>, <code>d</code>, <code>D</code>, <code>+d</code>, <code>+D</code>, <code>+1w</code>, etc.</p>\n\n<h3>Display</h3>\n\n<p>There are two display modes: <strong>Calendar</strong> and <strong>Journal</strong>.</p>\n\n<h4>Calendar</h4>\n\n<p>Shows you days on a grid.  Hover on a day to see it&#39;s notes (days with notes have a green background).  Click a day to see the journal for that day.</p>\n\n<h4>Journal</h4>\n\n<p>Shows you the notes for the day or days.  Notes have a button allowing the owner to delete them.  There are buttons by each day for adding notes of each permission type.</p>\n\n<h3>Setting the Date</h3>\n\n<p><code>--set|&lt;date&gt;</code> (GM Only) -- Use <code>--set</code> to adjust the current day.  The current day is what all relative days are calculated from and is highlighted yellow in the display.  Anywhere you can omit the day in a command, the current day is used instead.  If you specify an invalid day, the current day is used. </p>\n\n<h4>Examples</h4>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>!cal --set|023-1116</code> -- set the date explicitly to the 23rd day of the year 1116.</li>\n<li><code>!cal --set|+1w</code> -- set the date relatively by advancing the current date by a week.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Show Commands</h3>\n\n<p><code>--show[|&lt;date&gt;[|&lt;date&gt; ..]]</code> -- use <code>--show</code> to show a day.</p>\n\n<p><code>--show-week[|&lt;date&gt;]</code> -- Show the week (Monday-Sunday or the Holiday week) surrounding the provided date or the current date.</p>\n\n<p><code>--show-4week[|&lt;date&gt;]</code> -- As above, but shows also 1 week prior and 2 weeks hence from the date.</p>\n\n<p><code>--show-5week[|&lt;date&gt;]</code> -- As above, but shows 2 weeks prior and 2 weeks hence.</p>\n\n<p><code>--show-year[|&lt;date&gt;]</code> -- Shows the full year including the date.<br/><br/>\n* <strong>Note:</strong> This is the only command that will treat a bare number as a year. <code>!cal --show-year|1116</code> is equivalent to <code>!cal --show-year|001-1116</code>.</p>\n\n<p><code>--between|&lt;date&gt;|&lt;date&gt;</code> -- Shows all the days between the two dates.  Relative dates are still relative to the current day.</p>\n\n<h4>Modifiers</h4>\n\n<p><code>--details</code> -- Causes a list of days and notes to be shown, rather than a grid calendar. (This is the default for <code>--show</code>)</p>\n\n<p><code>--sparse</code> -- Causes a detail view to omit any days without notes.</p>\n\n<h4>Examples</h4>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>!cal --show</code> -- show&#39;s the current date.</li>\n<li><code>!cal --show|+1d</code> -- show&#39;s tomorrow.</li>\n<li><code>!cal --show|-1w</code> -- show&#39;s a week ago.</li>\n<li><code>!cal --show|1-1116|10-1116|16-1116</code> -- show&#39;s the 1st, 10th, and 16th days of the year 1116.</li>\n<li><code>!cal --show-week</code> -- show&#39;s the current week.</li>\n<li><code>!cal --show-week|+w</code> -- show&#39;s next week.</li>\n<li><code>!cal --show-year</code> -- show&#39;s the current year.</li>\n<li><code>!cal --between|023-1116|043-1116</code> -- shows all the days from the 23rd to the 43rd of the year 1116.</li>\n<li><code>!cal --between|023-1116|043-1116 --details --sparse</code> -- Shows the days with notes from the 23rd to the 43rd of the year 1116.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h4>Whisper Examples</h4>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>!wcal --show</code> -- Whisper the current day.  Whispering is the only time that notes other than public notes are displayed.</li>\n<li><code>!cal --show --whisper</code> -- Identical to the above.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Note commands</h3>\n\n<p><code>--note[|day][[|who] ...]|&lt;note text&gt;</code> -- adds a note.  If you omit the day, it is added for the current day.  You can specify who can see a note.  Use <code>gm</code> or <code>private</code> for a gm only note (also the default, you can just leave it off), <code>all</code> for a public note, or some part of a player&#39;s name to restrict it to just the matching players.  You can specify multiple <code>|</code> separated players.</p>\n\n<p><code>--remove-note[|day]|&lt;all|index&gt;</code> -- removes a note.  If you omit the date, it removes from the current day.  If you specify <code>all</code>, it will remove all the notes you created on that day (or all notes if you are the gm). If you specify a number, it will remove that index from the specified day (counting from the beginning, starting at 0).</p>\n\n<h4>Examples</h4>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>!cal --note|all|Hi everyone</code> -- adds a note on the current day for all players.</li>\n<li><code>!cal --note|Secret note.</code> -- adds a note for just the GM.</li>\n<li><code>!cal --note|tom|Tom&#39;s note.</code> -- adds a note for all players with <code>tom</code> in there name (ignoring spaces and capitalization).</li>\n<li><code>!cal --note|sally|tom|bob|Small group note.</code> -- adds a note for 3 or more players.</li>\n<li><code>!cal --note|10-1116|Bomb goes off.</code> -- adds a GM note on the 10th of the year 1116.</li>\n<li><code>!cal --note|10-1116|all|A good day to be off planet.</code> -- adds a note for all players on the 10th of the year 1116.</li>\n<li><code>!cal --remove-note|0</code> -- removes the first note on the current day.</li>\n<li><code>!cal --remove-note|all</code> -- removes all the notes on the current day.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Settings</h2>\n\n<p>The settings are accessible via the help screen using <code>!cal --help</code>.</p>\n\n<h3>Tool Tips</h3>\n\n<p>You can toggle the tool tips on the buttons in the <code>--details</code> display.  Once you know what the buttons do, the tool tips are a bit annoying.  Click the toggle button to adjust them.</p>\n\n<h3>Day Names</h3>\n\n<p>Click the name button to change the name.</p>\n<div id='patreon-link' class='alert alert-info'><div style='float: left; width: 80px;'><a target='_blank' href='https://www.patreon.com/shdwjk'><img src='https://app.roll20.net/images/patreon_logo.png'></a></div><div style='margin-left: 100px;'>You can support development of this script by contributing to the <a target='_blank' href='https://www.patreon.com/shdwjk'>Patreon Campaign</a> of the author. <div style='font-size: 0.9em;'>This Patreon campaign is not affiliated with Roll20; as such, contributions are voluntary and Roll20 cannot provide support or refunds for contributions.</div></div></div>"

In the case that there are not any matching TokenMarkers, it will return an empty array.\r\n```javascript\r\n    let statuses = libTokenMarker.getStatuses( 'marked' );\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### `libTokenMarkers.getOrderedList( )`\r\n| Argument | Value                | \r\n| -------- | ------               | \r\n| [return] | array of TokenMarker | \r\n\r\nThis function will return an array of all TokenMarkers, in the order they appear in the user interface.\r\n```javascript\r\n    let allStatuses = libTokenMarker.getOrderedList();\r\n```\r\n\r\n## TokenMarker Object Reference\r\n\r\nAll of the functions above return objects in the TokenMarker class hierarchy.  This provides a uniform interface to the four different types of status markers you might need to deal with:\r\n* Text -- the `dead` status and its red **X**\r\n* Color Dot -- the color statuses like `blue` and `pink`, and their non-image based visual\r\n* Legacy Markers -- the basic set like `archery-target` and `drink-me`, where the name and tag are the same\r\n* Custom Token Markers -- the new dynamic statuses with their images, names, and numbered tags\r\n\r\nThe TokenMarker object has 3 functions on it, detailed below.\r\n\r\n### `.getName()`\r\n| Argument | Value  | \r\n| -------- | ------ |\r\n| [return] | string | \r\n\r\nThis function returns the text name that was given to the status when it was created.\r\n\r\n### `.getTag()`\r\n| Argument | Value  | \r\n| -------- | ------ |\r\n| [return] | string | \r\n\r\nThis function returns the text tag that you use for setting it or checking if it is on a token.\r\n\r\n### `.getHTML( [scale], [css] )`\r\n| Argument           | Value                      | \r\n| --------           | ------                     | \r\n| scale *(optional)* | number (**Default:** 1.4 ) | \r\n| css *(optional)*   | css string                 | \r\n| [return]           | HTML string                | \r\n\r\nThis function returns a formatted HTML string which can be output in chat to display what the status looks like.  This is one of the main benefits of the TokenMarker object.  The `scale` parameter can be used to adjust the size of the visual with respect to the text that surrounds it.  Generally, you won't need to supply a parameter as the output will be scaled with the text it is associated with:\r\n```javascript\r\n    let tm = libTokenMarkers.getStatus('blue');\r\n    sendChat('',`<p>Blue at nomral size: ${tm.getHTML()}</p>`);\r\n    sendChat('',`<h1>Blue at title size: ${tm.getHTML()}</h1>`);\r\n```\r\n\r\n### `.applyTo(...tokens)`\r\n| Argument | Value  | \r\n| -------- | ------ |\r\n| tokens   | Roll20 token object, objects, or array of objects | \r\n\r\nThis function places this Token Marker on each token supplied to the function.  You can supply a Roll20 Token object, or multiple parameters that are Roll20 Token objects, or arrays of Roll20 Token objects.\r\n```javascript\r\n    let tm = libTokenMarkers.getStatus('blue');\r\n    tm.applyTo(token1, token2);\r\n    tm.applyTo(tokenArray);\r\n```\r\n\r\n### `.applyWithNumberTo(number, ...tokens)`\r\n| Argument | Value  | \r\n| -------- | ------ |\r\n| number   | an integer between 0 and 9 |\r\n| tokens   | Roll20 token object, objects, or array of objects | \r\n\r\nThis function places this Token Marker, with the supplied number assigned to it, on each token supplied to the function.  The Number must be the first argument, then you can supply a Roll20 Token object, or multiple parameters that are Roll20 Token objects, or arrays of Roll20 Token objects.\r\n```javascript\r\n    let tm = libTokenMarkers.getStatus('blue');\r\n    tm.applyTo(3, token1, token2);\r\n    tm.applyTo(7, tokenArray);\r\n```\r\n\r\n### `.removeFrom(...tokens)`\r\n| Argument | Value  | \r\n| -------- | ------ |\r\n| tokens   | Roll20 token object, objects, or array of objects | \r\n\r\nThis function removes the Token Marker on each token supplied to the function.  You can supply a Roll20 Token object, or multiple parameters that are Roll20 Token objects, or arrays of Roll20 Token objects.\r\n```javascript\r\n    let tm = libTokenMarkers.getStatus('blue');\r\n    tm.removeFrom(token1, token2);\r\n    tm.removeFrom(tokenArray);\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Example Script\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n/* global libTokenMarkers */\r\non('ready', ()=>{\r\n\r\n\t// Make sure libTokenMarkers exists, and has the functions that are expected\r\n\tif('undefined' === typeof libTokenMarkers\r\n\t\t|| (['getStatus','getStatuses','getOrderedList'].find(k=>\r\n\t\t\t!libTokenMarkers.hasOwnProperty(k) || 'function' !== typeof libTokenMarkers[k]\r\n\t\t))\r\n\t) { \r\n\t\t// notify of the missing library\r\n\t\tsendChat('',`/w gm <div style=\"color:red;font-weight:bold;border:2px solid red;background-color:black;border-radius:1em;padding:1em;\">Missing dependency: libTokenMarkers</div>`);\r\n\t} else {\r\n\r\n\t\t// active code\r\n\t\ton('chat:message',(msg) => {\r\n\r\n\t\t\tif('api'===msg.type && /^!test-ltm/i.test(msg.content)){\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tlet tokens = (msg.selected || [])\r\n\t\t\t\t\t.map(o=>getObj('graphic',o._id))\r\n\t\t\t\t\t.filter(g=>undefined !== g)\r\n\t\t\t\t\t;\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tlet all = libTokenMarkers.getOrderedList();\r\n\t\t\t\tlet statLast = all[all.length-1];\r\n\t\t\t\tlet statGreen = libTokenMarkers.getStatuses('green');\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tlet statBlue = libTokenMarkers.getStatus('BlUe');\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tsendChat('',`<div>Found ${all.length} statuses.</div>`);\r\n\t\t\t\tsendChat('',`<div>Last one is named \"${statLast.getName()}\" with tag \"${statLast.getTag()}\" and looks like ${statLast.getHTML(3)}.</div>`);\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tsendChat('',`<div>There are ${statGreen.length} statuses named green: ${statGreen.map(s=>s.getHTML(1,\"border:1px solid green;padding: .1em; border-radius: .3em; margin: .2em;\")).join('')}</div>`);\r\n\t\t\t\tsendChat('',`<div>Looked up \"${statBlue.getName()}\" with \"BlUe\", looks like ${statBlue.getHTML(3)}.</div>`);\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tlet nope = libTokenMarkers.getStatus('asdfasdfasdafsd');\r\n\t\t\t\tlet nopes = libTokenMarkers.getStatuses('asdfasdfasdafsd');\r\n\t\t\t\tsendChat('',`<div>Looked up \"asdfasdfasdfasdf\", found name: \"${nope.getName()}\", tag: \"${nope.getTag()}\", image: ${nope.getHTML()}</div>`);\r\n\t\t\t\tsendChat('',`<div>There are ${nopes.length} statuses named \"asdfasdfasdfasdf\".</div>`);\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tsendChat('',`<div><h3>All Statuses</h3><table style=\"border:1px solid #999;padding:.2em;\"><thead><tr><th style=\"padding: 1px .1em;\">Icon</th><th style=\"padding: 1px .1em;\">Name</th><th style=\"padding: 1px .1em;\">Tag</th></tr></thead><tbody>${\r\n\t\t\t\t\tall.map((s,n)=>`<tr style=\"background-color:${n%2?'#fff':'#ccc'}\"><td style=\"padding: 1px .1em;\">${s.getHTML()}</td><td style=\"padding: 1px .1em;\">${s.getName()}</td><td style=\"padding: 1px .1em;\">${s.getTag()}</td></tr>`).join('')\r\n\t\t\t\t}</tbody></table></div>`);\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tstatGreen[0].applyTo(tokens);\r\n\t\t\t\tsetTimeout(()=>{\r\n\t\t\t\t\tstatGreen[0].removeFrom([tokens]);\r\n\t\t\t\t},5000);\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tstatBlue.applyWithNumberTo(5,tokens[0]);\r\n\t\t\t\tsetTimeout(()=>{\r\n\t\t\t\t\tstatBlue.applyWithNumberTo(3,tokens[0]);\r\n\t\t\t\t},3000);\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\tsetTimeout(()=>{\r\n\t\t\t\t\tstatBlue.removeFrom(tokens[0]);\r\n\t\t\t\t},8000);\r\n\t\t\t}\r\n\t\t});\r\n\t}\r\n});\r\n```\r\n",

        "description": "**`libTypes`** provides a collection of classes for use by developers in other scripts.  Currently, they are primarily focused on spacial organization of data, but there may be other types in future releases.\r\r## Depending on `libTypes`\r\rTo require `libTypes` for your script, add `\"libTypes\"` to the `\"dependencies\"` property of your `script.json`:\r\r```json\r\"dependencies\": [\"libTypes\"]\r```\r\rFor convenience, you may want to import the types into the scope of your script:\r```javascript\rconst {Rect,Quadtree} = libTypes;  // eslint-disable-line no-unused-vars\r```\r\r## Class Reference\r\r# `Rect`\r\r`Rect` is an Axis-Aligned Bounding Box implementation.  It can be created automatically from the following Roll20 types: `page`, `path`, `text`, and `graphic`.  Rect is intended as a fast placeholder representing real objects in a spacial graph, such as `Quadtree`.\r\r## Creation Functions\r### `Rect(x,y,width,height)`\rThe constructor creates an instance of a `Rect`. `(x,y)` represents the center of the AABB, `width` and `height` are it's external dimensions.\r```javascript\rlet r = new Rect(70,140,35,35);\r```\r\r### `Rect.fromRoll20(roll20Obj)`\rThis static method creates a new `Rect` instance which is appropriate to the type of object passed in.  Internally, it will detect the Roll20 type and delegate to one of the for static methods below.\r```javascript\rlet obj = findObjs({ /* ... */ })[0];\rlet r = Rect.fromRoll20(obj);\r```\r\r### `Rect.fromPage(roll20Page)`\rThis static method creates a new `Rect` instance from a Roll20 `Page` object.\r```javascript\rlet page = findObjs({ type: 'page', /* ... */ })[0];\rlet r = Rect.fromRoll20(page);\r```\r\r### `Rect.fromGraphic(roll20Graphic)`\rThis static method creates a new `Rect` instance from a Roll20 `Graphic` object.\r```javascript\rlet graphic = findObjs({ type: 'graphic', /* ... */ })[0];\rlet r = Rect.fromRoll20(graphic);\r```\r\r### `Rect.fromPath(roll20Path)`\rThis static method creates a new `Rect` instance from a Roll20 `Path` object.\r```javascript\rlet path = findObjs({ type: 'path', /* ... */ })[0];\rlet r = Rect.fromRoll20(path);\r```\r\r### `Rect.fromText(roll20Text)`\rThis static method creates a new `Rect` instance from a Roll20 `Text` object.\r```javascript\rlet text = findObjs({ type: 'text', /* ... */ })[0];\rlet r = Rect.fromRoll20(text);\r```\r\r# `Quadtree`\r\r`Quadtree` is a spacial partitioning data structure designed to allow rapid searching for objects in an area at runtime.\r\r## Creation Functions\r### `Quadtree(rect, config = {})`\rThe constructor creates a `Quadtree` representing a given division of a Cartesian grid.  The `rect` parameter is a `Rect` instance that describes the division the `Quadtree` represents.  Usually this will be the return from `Rect.fromPage(roll20Page)`.  The optional `config` parameter can have the following properties set:\r\r* `maxObjects` -- The number of objects to store in a node before splitting into four sub trees. (**Default:** `10`)\r* `maxDepth` -- The maximum number of times to split when `maxObjects` is exceeded. (**Default:** `4`)\r\r```javascript\rlet page = findObjs({ type: 'page', /* ... */ })[0];\rlet q = new Quadtree(Rect.fromPage(page), { maxObjects: 20, maxDepth: 10 });\r```\r\r## Public Interface\r\r### `insert(rect, context)`\rInserts `rect` into the `Quadtree`.  If `context` is provided, it will be returned along with `rect` whenever it is retrieved.\r```javascript\rlet objs = findObjs({ type: 'graphic', pageid: page.id, /* ... */ });\robjs.forEach( o => q.insert( Rect.fromGraphic(o), {id: o.id} ) );\r```\r\r### `retrieve(rect)`\rRetrieves all the inserted objects which intersect with `rect`.  The return is an array of objects with the properties `rect` and `context`.  Both are references to the originally inserted `rect` and `context` objects.\r```javascript\rlet o = getObj( 'graphic', someid );\rlet collides = q.retrieve(Rect.fromGraphic(o));\r```\r\r### `remove(func, rect)`\rRemoves any inserted objects that return true when provided to the predicate `func`.  The predicate function `func` is called with the `context` object for each inserted object.  If a `rect` is supplied, only objects in that `Rect` are filtered using `func`.\r```javascript\rlet o = getObj( 'graphic', someid );\rq.remove( (c)=>c.id === o.id );\r```\r\r### `clear()`\rRemoves all inserted objects from the `Quadtree`.\r\r```javascript\rq.clear();\r```\r",

        "description": "# Meta Macros\n\nThis script extends the Roll20 macro \"language\" by enabling:\n\n* comments `// like this one`\n* multi-line commands, indicated by `\\` at end of line\n* textual inclusion of other macros using `$include macroname`\n* **textual substitution macros** like\n`$attack(hit,dam) = /me hits AC [[1d20+{hit}]] for [[1d8+{dam}]] damage`\n\nMacros written in this extended format can be cross-compiled into standard Roll20 macros for execution.\n\nNote that the term *macro* in the Roll20 context refers to scripts containing multiple commands.\nWe use the term *meta-macro* to refer to C-style macros (i.e. textual substitution rules).\n\n## Syntax\n\n#### Comments\n\nWhenever two forward-slashes `//` are encountered, the remainder of the line is treated as a comment and stripped.\n\n#### Multi-line commands\n\nWhenever a backslash `\\` is encountered at the end of a line, the backslash will be stripped and the line will be concatenated with the following line.\n\n#### Including macros\n\nThe `$include macroname` command (which must appear on a line of its own) will cause the content of the macro `macroname` to be included in the current macro, in place of the `$include` command.\nAn exception to this is that if a macro has previously been included, it won't be included again (this prevents infinite circular includes).\n\n#### Meta-macros\n\nMeta-macro definitions take the format\n\n```\n$name(param_0, ..., param_n) = body\n```\n\nwhere `name`, `param_0` ... `param_n` are identifiers, i.e., non-empty strings consisting of alpha-numberic characters and/or `_`.\nFor meta-macros without any parameters, the `(` brackets `)` can be omitted.\n\nAfter a meta-macro has been defined, any occurrance of `$name(arg_0, ..., arg_n)` will be replaced with the `body` of the meta-macro definition.\nHere any occurance of `{param_0}` ... `{param_n}` in `body` will  be replaced with `arg_0` ... `arg_n`, respectively.\nIf `arg_0` ... `arg_n` contain any meta-macro invocations, these will be resolved first.\nIf the number of arguments does not match the number of parameters in the meta-macro definition, missing arguments will be treated as the empty string, while extra arguments will be discarded.\nFor meta-macro invocations without any arguments, the `(` brackets `)` can be omitted.\n\nIf the `body` in a meta-macro definition contains any meta-macro invocations, these will be resolved at the time of definition (this prevents infinite circular resolution).\nAs a result the order of meta-macro definitions matters:\n\n```\n$attack = [[1d20+$bab]]\n$bab = 5\n/me hits AC $attack\n```\n\nwill compile into `/me hits AC [[1d20+$bab]]` as `$bab` was undefined at the time `$attack` was defined.\n\n#### Numerical evaluation (since 1.1)\n\nWhen using the `:=` operator in a meta-macro definition, the body will be evaluated numerically. Supports `(` brackets `)`, operators `+`, `-`, `*` and `/`, and functions `ceil` and `floor`. Evaluation takes place after substitution, so care must be taken about operator precedence as usual:\n\n```\n$pow = 1 + floor(10/4)\n$dam := 2 * $pow\n```\n\nwill first substitute the body of `$dam` to `2 * 1 + floor(10/4)` and then evaluate it to `4`.\n\n## Example\n\n\\_inc\\_stats:\n\n```\n$bab = 6 // base attack bonus\n$str = 5 // strength modifier\n```\n\nattack:\n\n```\n$include _inc_stats\n$pow = floor(1+$bab/4) // power attack\n$hit(mod) = [[1d20cs>19+[[$bab+$str-$pow{mod}]]]]\n$dam(dice,str_mult,bonus) = [[{dice}+[[floor($str{str_mult}){bonus}]]]]\n// main hand attack gets full strength bonus and power attack\n$att_main(hit_mod) = $hit({hit_mod}) AC for $dam(1d8,,+2*$pow) damage\n// offhand attack is light weapon => half strength bonus and no power attack\n$att_off(hit_mod) = $hit({hit_mod}) AC for $dam(1d6,*0.5) damage\n\n&{template:default} {{name=Full Attack}} \\\n{{1st (MH) = $att_main}} \\\n{{2nd (MH) = $att_main(-5)}} \\\n{{1st (OH) = $att_off}} \\\n{{2nd (OH) = $att_off(-5)}}\n```\n\nHere macro *attack* will compile into\n\n```\n&{template:default} {{name=Full Attack}} {{1st (MH) = [[1d20cs>19+[[6+5-floor(1+6/4)]]]] AC for [[1d8+[[floor(5)+2*floor(1+6/4)]]]] damage}} {{2nd (MH) = [[1d20cs>19+[[6+5-floor(1+6/4)-5]]]] AC for [[1d8+[[floor(5)+2*floor(1+6/4)]]]] damage}} {{1st (OH) = [[1d20cs>19+[[6+5-floor(1+6/4)]]]] AC for [[1d6+[[floor(5*0.5)]]]] damage}} {{2nd (OH) = [[1d20cs>19+[[6+5-floor(1+6/4)-5]]]] AC for [[1d6+[[floor(5*0.5)]]]] damage}}\n```\n\nwhich can be executed as normal.\n\n## Chat commands\n\nNote that all compilation will replace any existing content of the target macro.\n\n#### Compile a specific source macro into a target macro\n\nThe `!compile sourceMacro targetMacro` command will compile `sourceMacro` into `targetMacro`.\n\n#### Compile a specific source macro\n\nThe `!compile sourceMacro` command will compile `sourceMacro` into `_sourceMacro_`.\n\n#### Compile all source macros\n\nThe `!compile all` command will compile all macros which (1) do not start with `_`, and (2) contain extension-specific code.\n\nTo avoid unnecessary compilation of include files, it is recommended to start their name with `_`, e.g. `_inc_common_macros`.\n\n## Known issues\n\n#### Escaping special characters\n\nThere is currently no way to escape characters `$`, `/` or `\\` to ensure they are treated as normal characters.\nAs a workaround, you can define meta-macros for this:\n\n```\n$dollar = $\n$empty =\nThe $dollar()empty command evaluates to the empty string.\nThis /$empty/ is not a comment.\nAnd this is not a \\$empty\nmulti-line command.\n```\n\n#### String literals\n\nString literals `\"like this one\"` in the macro text do not receive special treatment. This means that e.g.\n\n```\n/w \"Guy with//weird name\" Hello weirdo!\n```\n\nwill be compiled into\n\n```\n/w \"Guy with\n```\n\n#### Compile all\n\nThe `!compile all` command will consider a script to contain extension-specific code if any line in that script starts with `$`,\neven if this line is not an `$include` statement or meta-macro definition.",

Supports <code>(</code> brackets <code>)</code>, operators <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>*</code> and <code>/</code>, and functions <code>ceil</code> and <code>floor</code>. Evaluation takes place after substitution, so care must be taken about operator precedence as usual:</p>\n\n<p><code><br/>\n$pow = 1 + floor(10/4)<br/>\n$dam := 2 * $pow<br/>\n</code></p>\n\n<p>will first substitute the body of <code>$dam</code> to <code>2 * 1 + floor(10/4)</code> and then evaluate it to <code>4</code>.</p>\n\n<h2>Example</h2>\n\n<p>_inc_stats:</p>\n\n<p><code><br/>\n$bab = 6 // base attack bonus<br/>\n$str = 5 // strength modifier<br/>\n</code></p>\n\n<p>attack:</p>\n\n<p>```<br/>\n$include <em>inc</em>stats<br/>\n$pow = floor(1+$bab/4) // power attack<br/>\n$hit(mod) = [[1d20cs&gt;19+[[$bab+$str-$pow{mod}]]]]<br/>\n$dam(dice,str<em>mult,bonus) = [[{dice}+[[floor($str{str</em>mult}){bonus}]]]]<br/>\n// main hand attack gets full strength bonus and power attack<br/>\n$att<em>main(hit</em>mod) = $hit({hit<em>mod}) AC for $dam(1d8,,+2*$pow) damage<br/>\n// offhand attack is light weapon =&gt; half strength bonus and no power attack<br/>\n$att</em>off(hit<em>mod) = $hit({hit</em>mod}) AC for $dam(1d6,*0.5) damage</p>\n\n<p>&amp;{template:default} {{name=Full Attack}} \\<br/>\n{{1st (MH) = $att<em>main}} \\<br/>\n{{2nd (MH) = $att</em>main(-5)}} \\<br/>\n{{1st (OH) = $att<em>off}} \\<br/>\n{{2nd (OH) = $att</em>off(-5)}}<br/>\n```</p>\n\n<p>Here macro <em>attack</em> will compile into</p>\n\n<p><code><br/>\n&amp;{template:default} {{name=Full Attack}} {{1st (MH) = [[1d20cs&gt;19+[[6+5-floor(1+6/4)]]]] AC for [[1d8+[[floor(5)+2*floor(1+6/4)]]]] damage}} {{2nd (MH) = [[1d20cs&gt;19+[[6+5-floor(1+6/4)-5]]]] AC for [[1d8+[[floor(5)+2*floor(1+6/4)]]]] damage}} {{1st (OH) = [[1d20cs&gt;19+[[6+5-floor(1+6/4)]]]] AC for [[1d6+[[floor(5*0.5)]]]] damage}} {{2nd (OH) = [[1d20cs&gt;19+[[6+5-floor(1+6/4)-5]]]] AC for [[1d6+[[floor(5*0.5)]]]] damage}}<br/>\n</code></p>\n\n<p>which can be executed as normal.</p>\n\n<h2>Chat commands</h2>\n\n<p>Note that all compilation will replace any existing content of the target macro.</p>\n\n<h4>Compile a specific source macro into a target macro</h4>\n\n<p>The <code>!compile sourceMacro targetMacro</code> command will compile <code>sourceMacro</code> into <code>targetMacro</code>.</p>\n\n<h4>Compile a specific source macro</h4>\n\n<p>The <code>!compile sourceMacro</code> command will compile <code>sourceMacro</code> into <code>_sourceMacro_</code>.</p>\n\n<h4>Compile all source macros</h4>\n\n<p>The <code>!compile all</code> command will compile all macros which (1) do not start with <code>_</code>, and (2) contain extension-specific code.</p>\n\n<p>To avoid unnecessary compilation of include files, it is recommended to start their name with <code>_</code>, e.g. <code>_inc_common_macros</code>.</p>\n\n<h2>Known issues</h2>\n\n<h4>Escaping special characters</h4>\n\n<p>There is currently no way to escape characters <code>$</code>, <code>/</code> or <code>\\</code> to ensure they are treated as normal characters.<br/>\nAs a workaround, you can define meta-macros for this:</p>\n\n<p><code><br/>\n$dollar = $<br/>\n$empty =<br/>\nThe $dollar()empty command evaluates to the empty string.<br/>\nThis /$empty/ is not a comment.<br/>\nAnd this is not a \\$empty<br/>\nmulti-line command.<br/>\n</code></p>\n\n<h4>String literals</h4>\n\n<p>String literals <code>&quot;like this one&quot;</code> in the macro text do not receive special treatment. This means that e.g.</p>\n\n<p><code><br/>\n/w &quot;Guy with//weird name&quot; Hello weirdo!<br/>\n</code></p>\n\n<p>will be compiled into</p>\n\n<p><code><br/>\n/w &quot;Guy with<br/>\n</code></p>\n\n<h4>Compile all</h4>\n\n<p>The <code>!compile all</code> command will consider a script to contain extension-specific code if any line in that script starts with <code>$</code>,<br/>\neven if this line is not an <code>$include</code> statement or meta-macro definition.</p>\n"

        "description": "Search provides full text searching across handouts and characters (including attributes).  Search uses an Okapi BM25F+ search engine with Porter stemming and stop word removal to provide fast results after building initial indexes.  Index construction occurs at API startup, in the background.  The GM is notified when indexing is finished.  Indexing can take a few minutes, but won't slow down any other processes due to a great deal of deferring of processing.\r\rSearch respects permissions on handouts and characters.  GMs can search on all things, where as players can only search based on what they can see.  Seeing a handout allows a player to search on it's `name` and `notes` fields.  Seeing a character allows a player to search on it's `name` and `bio` fields.  Controlling a character allows searching on it's `attribute`s as well.  Only GMs can search on `gmnotes`.\r\r## Commands\r\r```!search --help|--reindex|<query>```\r\rThe interface to searching.\r\r* `--help` -- Displays this help in game.\r* `--reindex` -- Rebuilds the search index.  This can take a minute or two and is only necessary when you've made changes (like permissions) (GM Only).\r* `<query>` -- a collection of terms and modifiers to define what is important.  See **Search Query** below for full details. \r___\r## Search Query\rAt it's simplest, a Search Query is just a list of words you're interested in:\r```\r!search sun blade\r```\r\r### Terms\r\rThere are 6 basic ways to enter terms:\r* `term` -- Just a bare word will rank as normal.\r* `+term` -- Prepending with `+` marks a word as **important**, and it will be weighted double.\r* `-term` -- Prepending with `-` marks a word as **detracting**, and it's weight will be subtracted, lowering the document's score.\r* `*term` -- Prepending with `*` marks a word as **required**, and a document will be rejected if it doesn't have a match.\r* `~term` -- Prepending with `~` marks a word as **prohibited**, and a document with a match will be rejected.\r* `term^N` -- Appending a `^` with a number will multiply the weight of a term by that number.  Numbers can be proceeded by a - to make the term detract, and may have a decimal place.  The leading zero may be omitted.\r\rHere is an example using each modifier:\r```\r!search knight *king ~queen +prince -princess chamberlain^1.1 maid^-.3\r```\rThis will search for `knight`, require a match for `king`, reject any document that matches `queen`, reduce the score of for matching `princess`, rank `chamberlain` 1.1 times higher than normal and reduce the score for matching `maid` at about 1/3 the weight.\r\rPrepended modifiers can also be combine with direct weighting:\r```\r!search *king^.5 throne\r```\rMust match `king`, but at half it's relative weight.  `throne` is weighted normally.\r\r### Fields\rYou can specify search terms to apply only to a specific field using the `in:<field>` syntax:\r\r```\r!search in:bio parents\r```\rSearches for `parents` in just the `bio` field.  \r\rThe `in:<field>` syntax only applies to the next term listed.\r\r```\r!search in:bio parents dragon\r```\rSearches for `parents` in jut the `bio` field, and dragon in any field.\r\rIf you want to search for multiple terms in a field, you can surround them in parenthsis:\r\r```\r!search in:bio ( parents siblings brother sister )\r```\rSearch for `parents`, `siblings`, `brother`, and `sister` in the `bio` field.\r\rAnywhere you place terms, you can apply modifiers:\r```\r!search in:bio ( parents siblings +brother sister^3 )\r```\rAdditionally, you can apply the same modifiers to the `field` name to apply them to all the specified terms:\r```\r!search in:bio^2 ( brother sister ) dragon\r```\rBoth `sister` and `brother` in the `bio` field are weighted double what `dragon` is in all fields.\r\rYou can specify different weighting for terms in a `field` and out of it:\r```\r!search in:bio ( +dragon ) dragon\r```\rThe most spcific rule is applied.  `dragon` in `bio` will be ranked double what `dragon` elsewhere is.\r\rIf you modify the `field` and the `term`, they are combined in the ways you would expected:\r\r```\r!search in:+bio ( +dragon wyvern ) dragon wyvern\r```\r`dragon` in bio is x4, `wyvern` in bio is x2, `dragon` and `wyvern` elsewhere are normally weighted.\r\r### Categories\r\rYou can specify search terms to apply only to a specific category using the `on:<category>` syntax:\r```\r!search on:handout gemstone\r```\rSearch for `gemstone` in all fields of `handout`s.\r\rJust like with `in:<field>`, you can use parenthesis to group terms:\r```\r!search on:character( knight paladin )\r```\rSearch for `knight` and `paladin` in all fields of `character`s.\r\rAlso like `field`s, the `category` can be modified just like `term`s and passes the modifications down the same way.\r```\r!search on:character^1.2( knight paladin ) knight paladin\r```\r`knight` and `paladin` are ranked x1.2 when on a `character`.\r\rYou can nest `in:<field>` rules in `on:<category>` rules.\r```\r!search on:character^1.3( in:name +dragon dragon ) dragon\r```\r`dragon` in character name is worth x2.6, elsewhere on character is worth x1.2, and anywhere else is worth normal.\r\rYou can get as complicated as you like with this.\r```\r!search on:character( in:name( dragon -wyvern ~snake) +snake in:gmnotes^3 secret ) on:handout( *treasure *gold )\r```\rSearch for characters with `dragon`, preverably not `wyvern`, and flat out not metion of `snake` in the name, but rank higher for `snake` elsewhere and `secret` in gmnotes is x3.  Also include any handouts that mention both `treasure` and `gold`.\r\r## Results\r\rThe results are sorted based on the combination of the weights of all the terms they matched, then the top 30 are whispered to the user in the chat.\r\rEach result row contains a circle with an **H** for handout or **C** for character, followed by the name of the matching document with the folder it is in in smaller lettering above it.  The name of the document is a link that will open it.  At the top right is the total score for the document.  Along the bottom of each row are the terms the document matched, with the number of unique fields it matched in, followed by the portion of the score it contributed. This is followed by a list of fields with the number of unique terms matched and the contribution to the score.  Looking at these details can help you fine tune your search.",

        "description": "# Supernotes\r*by keithcurtis, expanded from code written by the Aaron.*\r\rThis script pulls the contents from a token's GM Notes field and sends them to chat, based on a user-selectable roll template. If the token represents a character, you can optionally pull in the Bio or GM notes from the character. The user can decide whether to whisper the notes to the GM or broadcast them to all players. Finally, there is the option to add a footer to notes whispered to the GM. This footer creates a chat button to give the option of sending the notes on to the players.\r\rThis script as written is optimized for the D&D 5th Edition by Roll20 sheet, but can be adapted easily suing the Configuration section below.\r\r* [SuperNotes forum thread](https://app.roll20.net/forum/post/8293909/script-supernotes)\r\r\r## Commands:\r\r**!gmnote** whispers the note to the GM\r\r**!pcnote** sends the note to all players\r\r**!selfnote** whispers the note to to the sender\r\r\r## Paramaters\r\r*--token* Pulls notes from the selected token's gm notes field. This is optional. If it is missing, the script assumes --token\r\r*--charnote* Pulls notes from the gm notes field of the character assigned to a token.\r\r*--bio* Pulls notes from the bio field of the character assigned to a token.\r\r*--avatar* Pulls the image from the avatar field of the character assigned to a token.\r\r--image Pulls first image from the bio field of the character assigned to a token, if any exists. Otherwise returns notice that no artwork is available\r\r*--images* Pulls all images from the bio field of the character assigned to a token, if any exist. Otherwise returns notice that no artwork is available\r\r*--image[number]* Pulls indexed image from the bio field of the character assigned to a token, if any exist. *--image1* will pull the first image, *--image2* the second and so on. Otherwise returns first image if available. If no images are available, returns notice that no artwork is available.\r\r*--notitle* This option suppresses the title in the chat output. It is useful for times when the GM might wish to show an image or note to the player without clueing them in wha the note is about. For instance, they may wish to reveal an image of a monster without revealing its name.\r\r*--id* supply this with a token id, and the script will attempt to read the notes associated with a specific token, or the character associate with that token. There is no space between --id and the token id. Only one token id may be passed.\r\r*--handout|Handoutname|* If this is present in the arguments, the note will be sent to a handout instead of chat. This can allow a note to remain usable without scrolling through the chat. It can also be used as a sort of floating palette. Notes in handouts can be updated. Running the macro again will regenerate the note. The string in between pipes will be used as the name of the note handout. If no handout by that name exists, Supernotes will create one and post a link in chat to open it.

If the token represents a character, you can optionally pull in the Bio or GM notes from the character. The user can decide whether to whisper the notes to the GM or broadcast them to all players. Finally, there is the option to add a footer to notes whispered to the GM. This footer creates a chat button to give the option of sending the notes on to the players.</p>\n\n<p>This script as written is optimized for the D&amp;D 5th Edition by Roll20 sheet, but can be adapted easily suing the Configuration section below.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://app.roll20.net/forum/post/8293909/script-supernotes\">SuperNotes forum thread</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Commands:</h2>\n\n<p><strong>!gmnote</strong> whispers the note to the GM</p>\n\n<p><strong>!pcnote</strong> sends the note to all players</p>\n\n<p><strong>!selfnote</strong> whispers the note to to the sender</p>\n\n<h2>Paramaters</h2>\n\n<p><em>--token</em> Pulls notes from the selected token&#39;s gm notes field.

Otherwise returns notice that no artwork is available</p>\n\n<p><em>--image[number]</em> Pulls indexed image from the bio field of the character assigned to a token, if any exist. <em>--image1</em> will pull the first image, <em>--image2</em> the second and so on. Otherwise returns first image if available. If no images are available, returns notice that no artwork is available.</p>\n\n<p><em>--notitle</em> This option suppresses the title in the chat output. It is useful for times when the GM might wish to show an image or note to the player without clueing them in wha the note is about. For instance, they may wish to reveal an image of a monster without revealing its name.</p>\n\n<p><em>--id</em> supply this with a token id, and the script will attempt to read the notes associated with a specific token, or the character associate with that token. There is no space between --id and the token id. Only one token id may be passed.</p>\n\n<p><em>--handout|Handoutname|</em> If this is present in the arguments, the note will be sent to a handout instead of chat. This can allow a note to remain usable without scrolling through the chat. It can also be used as a sort of floating palette. Notes in handouts can be updated. Running the macro again will regenerate the note. The string in between pipes will be used as the name of the note handout.

        "description": "# Teleport\r\r[Forum Teleport Discussion](https://app.roll20.net/forum/post/9436375/script-teleport-from-scratch-teleport-token) <= this has a how-to on using Teleport.\r\rThis script provides a way for GMs or players to teleport tokens within a page or between pages.\r\r## Installation\r\rOn installation, a note (*Teleport API*) is created, and help text appears in chat, both of which have buttons which activate the main menu. The note persists, and will not be re-created unless you remove the note, so you can always find and activate the menu button. You can also type ```!teleport --menu``` into chat. \r\r## Beginning Setup\rTo set up a teleport pad token, drag a token to the objects layer and then click on the chat button to \"Create Teleport Pad\" on the main menu.\r* You will be prompted with a naming box, name your teleport pad whatever you like. You can rename it later from the interface. This is for you to read, and is not used by the API to find portal pads, so don't worry about renaming it at any time. \r* The token will be automatically moved to the GM layer and set up with its initializing properties. Once you do this, the chat menu will pop up a list of teleport pads it detects on the page the **GM** is on currently. You can now use the teleport button on the chat (the emoji button that looks like sparkles, and gives you a tooltip of \"teleport token\" on mouseover) for that teleport pad to teleport a selected token to this teleport pad. \r\rTo set up auto-teleporting (players able to interact with one teleport pad that automatically moves them to another teleport pad), you need to **link** the first teleport pad you created to a second teleport pad. \r* Create a second teleport pad as you did the first one. \r* Now, go to the gmlayer and select both teleport pads. \r* On the teleport pad list, click the \"link\" button on either pad. Teleport is smart enough not to link a portal to itself, so it will add the **other** portal to the portal linking button you pressed, and it should list it this way (show the name of the linked portal in its \"linked to\" label).\r* If you want the portals to link to each-other and be a two-way teleport, repeat this for the second portal, so each shows \"linked\" to the other teleport pad.\r\rNow, on the objects layer, test this by dragging any token over one of the teleport pads. These pads are invisible to your players, so if you want them to find them it is good practice to put a visible marker of the teleport pad on the map layer. You should see the token move to the gm layer, move to the other teleport pad location, and re-appear on the token layer.\r\r## Cross-Page Teleport\r\rTo set up cross-page teleport, you must create teleport tokens on each page you want to link by way of teleport, and then use the Global Teleport Pad List to link them, similar to how you did in the **Beginning Setup**. You also must make sure that player tokens for each player you want to teleport exist in the target pages. Preferably, they should be on the GM layer. If you don't have player tokens on the target page, the teleport or auto-teleport will fail. Currently, the API has trouble with creating tokens on target pages (specifically to do with images from the Roll20 Marketplace), so **Teleport** doesn't try and make a player token on the target page at this point.\r\r## Some warnings: \r* Linking two pads, then copying one to another page will not work: teleport pads are linked by their unique IDs, and pasting a teleport pad to another page creates a new token with a new ID. It will keep links it has to **other teleport pads** but any links ***to*** it will be broken and will have to be re-set.\r* Cross-page teleport tries to spawn a specific page ribbon, and this will happen even if a player is not online - so teleporting player tokens to other pages when they are not online may have unforseen consequences. This is still being tested, and if out of synch can be \"fixed\" when all players are back online.\r\r## Creating API buttons from Teleport buttons\r\rAny activation of a button in chat will leave a record of what the command was - so you can press the up-arrow in chat to see the command that was passed to activate teleport.js. All commands are prefixed by !teleport and contain an attribute prefixed by two dashes to direct the command. ",
